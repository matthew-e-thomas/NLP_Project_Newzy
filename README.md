# NLP_Project_Newzy
An NLP and text analytics project on news articles for UVa Master's of Data Science class Exploratory Text Analytics

This project takes a csv file with scraped articles from Daily Kos, Politico, and Powerline, and performs a number of
text analysis functions, including parsing and tokenization, tf-idf, word embeddings, PCA, topic models, and sentiment analysis. This is an unsupervised learning project to see what insights can be gleaned from applying these methods.

PCA done with Scikit-Learn library.

Sentiment Analysis done with [Vader from NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/_modules/nltk/sentiment/vader.html)

TF-IDF computed from scratch

Word Embeddings done with word2vec in [Gensim](https://pypi.org/project/gensim/).

Topic Modelling done with [Mallet](http://mallet.cs.umass.edu/topics.php) program.
