                                  (Steven Hayward) I’ve been falling behind on many regular features these days, among them, the Power Line 100, but also the crucial subject of wine.  So here’s a quick catch up guide. Old timers of Paso Robles wines all know the Dusi name.  The Dusi family’s Zinfandel vineyards go back nearly a century.  For decades, if you wanted to find the best Zinfandels from the region, you wanted to find who bought the Dusi crop for that year.  The Dusi family seldom made their own wine—until now.  And here’s the four-minute storyboard for it.  (Footnote: I’ve met Janell Dusi a couple of times, and always said, “When are you guys going to start keeping your own grapes for yourselves?”  The time has come.) if(typeof(jQuery)==\"function\"){(function($){$.fn.fitVids=function(){}})(jQuery)};jwplayer('jwplayer-2').setup({\"aspectratio\":null,\"width\":580,\"height\":326,\"primary\":\"html5\",\"logo\":{\"file\":\"http://www.powerlineblog.com/pl_vid_bug_BW.png\",\"hide\":false,\"link\":\"http://www.powerlineblog.com\",\"position\":\"top-left\"},\"file\":\"http://youtu.be/efAbsW8KXn8\"});  We’ve also fallen behind with the latest from the Paso Wine Man, who offers up a defense of the much-maligned Merlot.  (I’ll add that I’m hugely thankful that Sideways was filmed down in Santa Barbara County rather than San Luis Obispo county, lest my favorite haunts be overrun with casual drinkers like SB County now is.) if(typeof(jQuery)==\"function\"){(function($){$.fn.fitVids=function(){}})(jQuery)};jwplayer('jwplayer-3').setup({\"aspectratio\":null,\"width\":580,\"height\":326,\"primary\":\"html5\",\"logo\":{\"file\":\"http://www.powerlineblog.com/pl_vid_bug_BW.png\",\"hide\":false,\"link\":\"http://www.powerlineblog.com\",\"position\":\"top-left\"},\"file\":\"http://youtu.be/eTr2erWTjgE\"});\n",

Someone, anyway, got access to the Times Editorial Board computers and turned out this parody editorial on Obamacare: Congressional Republicans have stoked consumer fears and confusion with charges that the health care reform law is causing insurers to cancel existing policies and will force many people to pay substantially higher premiums next year for coverage they don’t want. That, they say, violates President Obama’s pledge that if you like the insurance you have, you can keep it. Mr. Obama clearly misspoke when he said that. HaHaHaHaHa! President Obama misspoke 27 times! And curiously enough, when he misspoke it was the centerpiece of his argument for his supposedly signature legislative achievement! Even the Times editorial board wouldn’t try to sell that one; it’s got to be the Onion. By law, insurers cannot continue to sell policies that don’t provide the minimum benefits and consumer protections required as of next year. So they’ve sent cancellation notices to hundreds of thousands of people who hold these substandard policies. Sure! From now on you can pay extra for pediatric dental coverage, even if you don’t have any kids! (At issue here are not the 149 million people covered by employer plans, but the 10 million to 12 million people who buy policies directly on the individual market.) Here the Onion goes too far. It can’t expect us to believe that the Times editorial board is so ill-informed that it doesn’t realize we are talking about employer-sponsored group plans. As we wrote here, the Obama administration itself calculated, back in 2010, that more than one-half of all employer-sponsored plans will be dropped once Obamacare goes into effect. And that is just in the short term; in the long run, the Obama administration acknowledged that all current plans will be phased out and those covered by them will have to pay more, in some cases with help from the taxpayers or Chinese banks. Still, every good parody goes over the top at some point. Well done, Onion!\n",

                                                             (Scott Johnson) Obamacare was enacted on a foundational set of lies.  They are the centerpiece of our Lies of Obamacare series of posts, most recently featuring John’s important contribution.  Today Kyle Smith devotes a New York Post column to the lie that has consumed our attention over the past week or two.  Smith’s column puts an exclamation point on the exposure of Obama’s calculated deceit:  On June 15, 2009, Obama said, in one of hundreds of similar statements, “No matter how we reform health care, we will keep this promise to the American people: If you like your doctor, you will be able to keep your doctor, period. If you like your health-care plan, you’ll be able to keep your health-care plan, period. No one will take it away, no matter what.” This wasn’t just bulls – – t. This was a lie.  Smith column concludes:  There is no escape. What Obama said wasn’t true and that’s all there is to it. To the American public, he is a different man than he was last week. People can handle bulls – – t, but not dishonesty. We don’t like that. His approval rating touched an all-time low this week in the NBC/WSJ poll, and that was before his deception became the news of the week. Obama has rebranded himself as a liar, forever. He will carry this new label to his grave.  Whole thing here.\n",

        (Scott Johnson) It’s unfair to compare and contrast Barack Obama with commercial pitchmen hawking their wares, even if the goods do not conform to unqualified representations of fact.

a survey here in Minnesota that was reported on in today’s St. Paul Pioneer Press. The political results were predictably dreary; both Mark Dayton and Al Franken are favored for re-election, in part because hardly anyone has heard of any of their prospective GOP opponents. But for some reason, PPP also asked some sports questions, and they found an interesting split with regard to the Minnesota Vikings’ current quarterback controversy. Let’s back up. Two years ago, the Vikings were awful, finishing 3-13. Last year, they surprised everyone by going 10-6 and making the post-season, with Christian Ponder, who played well down the stretch, at the helm. This year the team is off to a poor start, currently 1-6. Ponder started the season at QB; Matt Cassel, a career back-up, has started one game–the only one the Vikings have won so far–and the team signed Josh Freeman when Freeman was cut by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Freeman has started one game, just days after he joined the team. He clearly was not in command of the offense, and looked awful. He also suffered a mild concussion in that game, which put Ponder back in the starting role. So here in Minnesota, we have a quarterback controversy, which is another way of saying we don’t have a very good quarterback. They don’t have quarterback controversies in New England or Denver. With that background, here are PPP’s findings: Ponder is the top QB choice among Republicans, with 34 percent of those polled, while Democrats prefer Josh Freeman, who got 30 percent of those polled. Let’s acknowledge up front that we are dealing at the margin of statistical significance. That said, the question is intriguing: why would Republicans tend to favor Ponder, and Democrats Freeman? Christian Ponder There is one obvious, stereotypical explanation: Republicans favor the guy who has had some success and is a known commodity. Democrats prefer to throw a hail-Mary on a guy who has only played one game, did a pretty horrible job, but has a strong arm and maybe some yet-unseen up-side. That could be the explanation. Josh Freeman But I suspect that something else is going on. It is striking, if you live here in Minnesota and especially if you read comments on stories in the Minneapolis Star Tribune sports pages, how some people hate Christian Ponder. They don’t just think he isn’t a very good quarterback; they don’t merely think he doesn’t have a very good arm. They hate him. Literally. Why? The only analogy I can think of is the way many liberals hate Tim Tebow. As it happens, Christian Ponder is a mini-Tebow. His parents weren’t kidding when they named him. As you might know, he married ESPN football reporter Samantha Steele last year. In this interview, he described Samantha as “a true woman of God.” Those are not, to be honest, the words that occurred to me when I first saw Ms. Steele. There are a number of other religious references in that interview, and most others Ponder has done. Samantha Ponder Is that why some–not all, by any means, but some–Democrats hate Ponder? I suspect that it is. Many liberals, maybe most, are actively anti-religious. They are engaged in a campaign to drive any positive references to religion out of the public sphere. A man like Christian Ponder, in that context, is beyond the pale. They hate him. I would like to be wrong, but I suspect that is what explains the partisan division in Minnesota’s quarterback controversy. For what it is worth, I am not a big pro football fan, but I will be rooting for Ponder and the Vikings tomorrow against the Dallas Cowboys.\n",

Government presumably is capable, at some point, of running a web site. It is the cancellation notices going out to millions of Americans that define the true Obamacare battle lines. We see here a naked exercise of state power, facilitated–not coincidentally–by state lies. It was always necessary that you should lose your insurance coverage, or, at a minimum, pay more for it; otherwise the whole Obamacare scheme would not work. And what we have seen so far is only the tip of the iceberg. In 2010, the Obama administration acknowledged, in the Federal Register, that pretty much everyone who has employer-sponsored insurance will lose their existing plans before long. So the cancellation notices have only just begun. This should be a learning moment for the American people. The great thing about freedom is that for the most part, you can do what you want. The trouble with statism is that someone is always telling you what to do, and that person doesn’t care about you or your family, and probably doesn’t like you much. There was a time when everyone knew this, but if it really has been forgotten by many Americans, Obamacare has come along at an opportune time. A reader writes: Obamacare is ripping off the mask of liberalism to reveal the totalitarian snarl behind Big Brother’s smile. “Million Dollar” Bill Maher — as cynical, obnoxious and contemptuous an Obama operative as can be found — does us all a huge service by openly reveling in Obamaland’s foundational lies. Since you’re too stupid and vicious even to know what’s good for you, let alone what the “public good” is, it is perfectly OK that we’re lying to you repeatedly…you deserve it! You’re welcome. “Million Dollar” Bill is very helpful here in identifying the rottenness of the central conceit of the New Class entitlement/regulatory state. Maher is right–the political arts are inherently those of deception, force, lies, hidden agendas, false promises and misdirection at a level that is simply not tolerable or even possible in ordinary life, especially in economic activity. This is exactly why we should severely limit the scope of politics and political processes in our lives to the bare minimum of real public goods. The fiasco of Obamacare has exposed this dichotomy like nothing else. An elite of intellectually dishonest political power mongers in a deceitful and corrupt process, purports to arrogate to themselves decisions about who can be lied to and dragooned into supporting and subsidizing what favored groups.   Unlike in commercial transactions where the lowliest consumer can choose to play or not, and can “exit” if he doesn’t like an actor’s offerings, when the state in involved you have no “exit”: they have law and force on their side. Oh, sure, you have a “voice.” You have the very political processes so aptly described by “Million Dollar” Bill filtered by a corrupt, supine and collusive MSM…one vote out of millions…with a premium on the rhetorical arts of misdirection. The liberal entitlement/regulatory state wants to subject as much of your life as possible to political processes, controlled by the New Class…with only your “voice” as a check, not an “exit”. The ugly reality behind their actions and motives is now exposed and the repercussions from this episode are just beginning to be felt. The principles behind Obamacare could easily be applied more widely. We could have Obamafood, for example. Everyone could be issued a card that contains data on his income; when you go to the grocery store, the card is scanned and a price generated. “That chicken will cost you $32.50 per pound, sir.” Or, “Congratulations! Those Pop Tarts are free!” Which is to say that someone else paid for them. We could have Obamacars–everyone is required to buy an expensive car, loaded up with purported safety devices manufactured by Democratic Party contributors, and how much you pay depends on how much money you earn. After all, lots of people will need subsidies to buy those expensive vehicles. And that is only the beginning! Obamahouses, Obamaclothes–why not? If the state knows best, there is no reason not to go all the way. Which, in one way or another, is what liberals have in mind. The battle over Obamacare is a clarifying moment. It will tell us whether the spirit of liberty is still alive in America.\n",

Mike Rogers’ questioning of Kathleen Sebelius was a highlight  of her appearance before the House Ways and Means Committee last Wednesday.  Rogers used his questions to show that codes on the Obamacare website are constantly being “swapped,” and that as a result, the security of the system can’t properly be tested and the personnel information supplied by those who use it isn’t secure.   Rogers is Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee.  When it comes to cyber-security issues, he knows what he’s talking about.  Sebelius was unable to answer Rogers’ questions of fact, much less address his concerns.    Today, as  John Fund reports, Rogers appeared on CBS’s Face the Nation, and called on the Obama administration to shut down the Obamacare site for security reasons:  They need to take the site down, stabilize it, meaning they can’t continue to add code every week, and then they need to stress test the system.  Unfortunately, none of that has happened.  And they admit it’s going to take six months. . . . .That is unacceptable for the protection of privacy of Americans’ information.  Before the White House dismisses Rogers’ statement as a case of partisan politics, it should consider this:  Dianne Feinstein, the liberal Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee said basically the same thing on the same program.  Feinstein told host Bob Schieffer:  I felt and I said this directly to the president’s chief of staff, that they ought to take down the website until it was right. They believe that they need to keep it running and that they can sort out the difficulties.  Fund reports points out that both Rogers and Feinstein have had private briefings on the security weaknesses of Healthcare.gov.  Their comments on CBS today show that the White House has been unable to assuage their concerns.  Clearly, the Obama administration places its political fears ahead of valid privacy concerns expressed by two senior members of Congress (one a Republican, the other a Democrat) with considerable relevant expertise.  But then, as the  Washington Post reported today, the Obama administration’s political fears go a long way towards explaining the failed launch of its Obamacare website.\n",

                                                                                                                    (Paul Mirengoff) Fifty years ago, when the idea still seemed novel and overly intrusive, conservatives sometimes complained that the welfare state aimed to take care of Americans “from the cradle to the grave.”  These days, however, the government is taking care of many Americans even after they reach the grave. The  Washington Post reports that “in the past few years, Social Security has paid $133 million to beneficiaries who [are] deceased.”  In addition, the federal retirement system has paid more than $400 million to retirees who have passed away.  And one federal aid program spent nearly $4 million to pay heating and air-conditioning bills for more 11,000 dead people.  As far as we know, however, the feds haven’t paid for phone calls made by the dead.   This wouldn’t be our federal government if it didn’t screw up both coming and going.  Thus, the Post reports that the feds falsely list as dead at least 750 new people per month.  And, adds the Post, “once you are on this list, it’s not easy to get off.” In fairness, it can’t be easy to keep track of all American deaths with complete accuracy (but neither can it be easy to invent 750 deaths per month).  After all, approximately 2.5 million Americans die each year. But having researched the matter, the Post’s David Fahrenthold concludes that payments to the dead at the current order of magnitude could be avoided.  “For government watchdogs,” he writes, “these are some of the most fixable — and therefore the most maddening — mistakes that the government makes.” The government, Fahrenthold finds, has simply neglected to fix the problem mainly because the money being doled out to the dead is other peoples’ money.  But this is probably not the sole explanation.  The feds had plenty of incentive to design a workable Obamacare website, yet lacked the competence to do so.   The same problems — lack of concern and lack of competence — plague the welfare state throughout its cradle-to-grave jurisdiction.  Which suggests to me that this jurisdiction should be rolled back.\n",

liberal establishment (but. . . oh, you know the rest) is gearing up rapidly for the 50th anniversary of the assassination of John F. Kennedy later this month.  Already we’re seeing some of the usual themes recycled: Kennedy was a wonderboy whose unlimited capacities would have ended the Cold War, achieved racial harmony, cured cancer, and delivered us into the land of milk and honey forever, but for the reactionary atmosphere in Dallas that somehow led a pro-Castro Communist to shoot him in cahoots with the CIA and the mob. That last detail—that Oswald was a Communist—never seems to cause even the slightest hesitation in the liberal narrative, but at least recent polls are showing a steady decline in the number of people who believe a (Oliver) Stoned view of the matter. If you really want to get the counternarrative, you have to read James Piereson’s fine book Camelot and the Cultural Revolution: How the Assassination of John F. Kennedy Shattered American Liberalism.  But if you live in the Boulder area, you can hear Piereson speak in person on the topic this Wednesday at 6:30 pm in the Old Main Chapel on the CU Boulder campus (I’ll be hosting and introducing him).  You can read the full details here. In one sentence, Piereson’s thesis is that liberals evaded the simplest truth about Kennedy’s killing: “President Kennedy was a victim of the Cold War.”  Piereson’s teaching: “The assassination of a popular president by a Communist should have generated a revulsion against everything associated with left wing doctrines. Yet something close to the opposite happened. In the aftermath of the assassination, left wing ideas and revolutionary leaders, Marx, Lenin, Mao, and Castro foremost among them, enjoyed a greater vogue in the United States than at any time in our history.” Piereson argues convincingly that it was the reaction to the assassination itself, within the mainstream American establishment as well as among liberal intellectuals, that caused liberalism essentially to suffer a nervous breakdown in the years that followed.

   (Scott Johnson) Edie Littlefield Sundby is in a life and death struggle with stage 4 gallbladder cancer.  She has defied the odds so far with the assistance of a world-class medical team paid for by a United Healthcare Group individual health policy.  She writes in the Wall Street Journal, however, that her luck may have just run out.  Her “affordable, lifesaving medical insurance policy has been canceled effective Dec. 31.”  It is gone with Obama’s promise that if she likes her plan, she can keep it.  Unfortunately, she is unable to find a suitable replacement.  Now what? if(typeof(jQuery)==\"function\"){(function($){$.fn.fitVids=function(){}})(jQuery)};jwplayer('jwplayer-2').setup({\"aspectratio\":null,\"width\":580,\"height\":326,\"primary\":\"html5\",\"logo\":{\"file\":\"http://www.powerlineblog.com/pl_vid_bug_BW.png\",\"hide\":false,\"link\":\"http://www.powerlineblog.com\",\"position\":\"top-left\"},\"file\":\"http://youtu.be/FoIgxb7ylbg\"});  Looking around on the Internet for a photo of Ms. Sundby to accompany this post, I found the video above  dating from earlier this year.  She tells the story of her struggle to that point. if(typeof(jQuery)==\"function\"){(function($){$.fn.fitVids=function(){}})(jQuery)};jwplayer('jwplayer-3').setup({\"aspectratio\":null,\"width\":580,\"height\":326,\"primary\":\"html5\",\"logo\":{\"file\":\"http://www.powerlineblog.com/pl_vid_bug_BW.png\",\"hide\":false,\"link\":\"http://www.powerlineblog.com\",\"position\":\"top-left\"},\"file\":\"http://youtu.be/L1NMRjakmtw\"});  In the video above she pays tribute to her “Band of Angels.”  In the text accompanying the video she writes: “I feel enormous joy and gratitude to be alive. For 6 years I have fought Stage 4 gall bladder cancer with the help of God, family, friends, doctors, nurses, and legions of angels in the backfield. This video is dedicated to the Band of Angels who have been there every step of the way – praying, treating, supporting, and loving.”  Now she needs one more angel over her shoulder.\n",

                                                           (Scott Johnson) Watching George Stephanopoulos conduct a friendly interview with Dan Pfeiffer yesterday on the ABC News Sunday gabfest, I wondered: Who is Pfeiffer and why is he talking so fast?  Pfeiffer, it turns out, is Assistant to the President and Senior Advisor to the President for Strategy and Communications.  Pfeiffer helpfully explicated the foundational lie of Obamacare about keeping your health insurance if you like it: “If you had your plan and it hasn’t been changed or canceled, you can keep it.”  Thanks, man, I really appreciate it. Watching this segment yesterday, one other question occurred to me: What did the president know and when did he know it?  I suppose we’ll get to the bottom of this obvious question around the time we hear from the American survivors of the Benghazi attack. The Wall Street Journal made some progress in answering that question over the weekend in an article behind the Journal’s subscription paywall.  The Journal article is discussed by Newbusters’ Tom Blumer here.  Stephanopoulos quotes from the Journal article in the windup to his question for Pfeiffer. So why is Pfeiffer talking so fast?  It might come naturally to him, but over in Strategy and Communication you must learn that the ability to talk fast can come in really, really handy.

The losers will consist mainly of middle class Americans, whose party allegiance is split.”        This piece in Politico supports my assessment.  It focuses on the initial wave of Obamacare losers, namely those who have lost their privately purchased health insurance and are thus forced, if they wish to remain insured, to purchase an Obamacare approved plan.   According to Politico writers Darren Samuelsohn and Jason Millman, between 10 and 20 million Americans have purchased health insurance on their own.  The Obama administration itself has  projected that most of them will lose that insurance.    Samuelsohn and Millman contend that these “Obamacare losers could pack a political punch.”  If anything, though, their description of the cohort — “married, older, white, college-educated, GOP-leaning Americans” — tends to understate that punch by implying that the disaffected are mostly natural Republicans anyway.    But later in the article we learn that, according to a survey by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, nearly half of those who brought their own insurance are between the ages of 18 and 44.  We also learn, thanks to a poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation, that there is no statistically significant difference between the political party affiliation of those who buy their own health care.   To be sure, when pressed, more people in this group say they lean Republican than Democrat.  But the Kaiser poll clearly supports my statement that the party allegiance of Obamacare losers (at least this set of them) is split.  Moreover, as one analyst quoted by Politico says, anger over cancellation letters is likely to cross party lines. The big question, of course, is how this anger will translate on Election Day 2014.  Apparently, there are not yet any data out there that help answer this question.  But Samuelsohn and Millman clearly believe that anger over insurance cancellations caused by Obamacare might well translate into serious problems for the Democrats.    It’s the shock of the change — especially after President Barack Obama repeatedly promised that anyone could keep the plan that they had — that is very real and threatens to resonate through the 2014 midterm campaign. “[Obama] may have known this is a more sophisticated issue – you’re going to get better, more benefits – but people who hear politicians are very literal,” said Harvard professor Bob Blendon, an expert on public attitudes toward health care policy.  Again, Samuelsohn and Millman understate the problem for Democrats.  It’s not just shock in the abstract, coupled with Obama’s broken promise, that is driving anger.  Nor is the anger due to lack of sophistication.  Kaiser found that, on average, purchasers of private insurance pay an average premium of $385, with a $3,754 average deductible.  If the reporting on the exchanges is anywhere close to accurate, these folks are not finding plans this economically desirable under Obamacare.  Rather, the plans they find are like ones they rejected, or never even considered, pre-Obamacare.   Moreover, folks are unlikely to be moved by claims that they are losing nothing more than “bad apple” insurance that can be replaced by a better plan with more benefits are.  Kaiser found that nearly everyone who buys private insurance shops first.  Most are unlikely to regard the insurance they selected after doing their homework — and rejecting plans with more forms of coverage — as rotten. It is true that some who lose their private plans will be eligible for subsidies.  But the polling cited by Politico show that most are too well-off for that. To make matters worse for the Democrats, Politico also suggests that the class angered as a result of folks losing their private insurance won’t be limited to the victims themselves.    “For every one person who gets their policy cancelled, that fact could influence maybe three or four other voters as well. It has a potential to spiral to not just people it immediately affects, but others,” said David Hogberg, a health care policy analyst for the National Center for Public Policy Research, a conservative think tank.  Finally, I should note,  as John has, that those who lose coverage under a private plan represent just the tip of the iceberg of Obamacare losers.  The Obama administration has calculated that half of all employer plans will be terminated as a result of Obamacare.   The class of Obamacare losers created by this wave of cancellations isn’t likely to be any better amused than the class created by the initial wave.  And the second wave will be greater in magnitude and longer in duration.\n",

revelations about Obamacare, and in particular, the healthcare.gov web site. As Paul noted, tech chief Henry Chao testified as much as 40 percent of the IT systems required to support the federal exchange do not yet exist. Beyond that, serious questions were raised about the web site’s security, and a March report by McKinsey came to light that suggested the Obama administration had ample notice that healthcare.gov would not be ready for prime time. I don’t know how many McKinsey reports you have seen; I have read quite a few of them, as they often surface in civil litigation. In my experience, they tend to be heavily bureaucratic but with flashes of color of the sort that trial lawyers like. You can read McKinsey’s report on the progress of healthcare.gov here. It doesn’t take much reading between the lines to figure out that the Obamacare web site was in deep trouble. I like this page, which contrasts the way a massive project of this sort should be carried out with the way the Obama administration was developing healthcare.gov:  A fair paraphrase would be: You, President Obama, are doing every single thing wrong. While the web site issues give rise to an entirely appropriate sense of schadenfreude, they are of relatively little importance. I assume that eventually, by brute force and the expenditure of billions of dollars, the administration will be able to create a web portal that more or less functions. But the real problems with Obamacare have little or nothing to do with the web site; they have everything to do with the substance of the law. The first wave of revulsion occurred when it became evident that millions of Americans in the individual and small group markets were losing their health insurance, contrary to the Democrats’ oft-repeated promise that if you like your health insurance, you can keep it. The falsity of that promise has dealt a devastating and well-deserved blow to Barack Obama’s credibility, and the lie will haunt every Democratic Senator or Congressman who runs for reelection next year.  For the next year or more there will be a rolling fiasco as millions of Americans lose their coverage not only in the individual market, but in the employer-sponsored market that covers most people. The Obama administration predicted in 2010 that over half of all Americans who have employer-sponsored group plans will lose them during Obamacare’s first year; those tens of millions of people will be distinctly unhappy. That will be the second wave of disgust with Obamacare. The third wave of revulsion will overlap with the second; it will come when people realize–again, in both the individual market and the employer-sponsored market–that Obamacare has made their health insurance coverage more expensive. President Obama’s promise that the average family will save $2,500 annually in insurance premiums is an absurdity. Anyone with any sense can see that Obamacare will be more expensive than what came before, not less expensive. The $2,500 promise will soon be as notorious as the “if you like your insurance, you can keep it” pledge. The only ones who save money will be those who are heavily subsidized by their neighbors. They will be ashamed to admit who they are. This disaster will unfold inexorably. It has nothing to do with the web site; rather, it is the intended consequence of the Democrats’ plan. All Republicans need to do is stay out of the way as Obamacare implodes and drives Democrats from office. When Democrats plead for help in “fixing” Obamacare on a bipartisan basis, Republicans must just say No.\n",

No sensible person disputes that we work out our ideas in space and time with great difficulty, but Obama’s use of “may” is extremely telling, like the academics I meet who unfailing say “Lincoln was right—for his time.”  What about our time, today?  What about Lincoln’s view that the self-evident truths of the Declaration were true everywhere and always, as Jefferson put it?  I’d bet a lot of money that Obama does not believe that.  Does Joel really believe differently about Obama’s deepest philosophical views?  Why would Obama believe differently?  It is the overwhelming teaching of the ivy leagues where Obama marinated.  (And I believe a close reading of his 2008 Philadelphia speech on race fully bears this out.) To be sure, I discover that most liberals, when pressed, repudiate their historicism and moral relativism instantly.  How else to criticize genocide in Darfur, which criticism violates all of the simpleminded canons of “multiculturalism”?  But liberals are typically unable to give any coherent account of the ground of their moral sanctions, which is why modern liberalism appears more often as sheer willfulness. Liberals like the Gettysburg Address mostly because of its flowery rhetoric.  Conservatives who like it (which is not all conservatives—an important point for another time) do so because they think it is true.  On this occasion of the 150th anniversary of the Gettysburg Address, it may be useful to take in one of Harry Jaffa’s meditations on the problem: Confronted with a statement of principles beginning “We hold these truth to be self-evident,” most writers, even the most learned, assume that what follows are merely the subjective opinions of a bygone age, possessing no more truth for us than anything else that may be agreeable to our passions.  From this perspective, there can be no ground for denying that justice is the interest of the stronger, in the sense that Thrasymachus originally intended.  From this perspective, Socrates may remain forever in the Piraeus, but there will be no dialogue on justice. Jaffa always liked to point to Carl Becker’s otherwise fine 1922 book on the Declaration of Independence, still the best book on the Declaration in many respects, for expressing the modern liberal sensibility that Obama surely shares, when Becker wrote: “To ask whether the natural rights philosophy of the Declaration of Independence is true or false is essentially a meaningless question.”  Meaningless, because, for Becker, Darwin had shown us the mutability of all nature, including human nature.  The faith of the founders, Becker concluded, “could not survive the harsh realities of the modern world.” And yet, when Becker reissued his book in the fall of 1941—in the shadow of the European and soon to be American war—he struck a very different note in a new introduction: “[It] may be thought that just now, when political freedom, already lost in many countries, is everywhere threatened, the readers of books would be more than ordinarily interested in the political principles of the Declaration of Independence.  Certainly recent events throughout the world have aroused an unwonted attention to the immemorial problem of human liberty.” Suddenly, in the newly extreme circumstances of 1941—the latest “harsh reality of the modern world” to quote Becker—the older principles of liberty, taken for granted as obsolete and superseded by Woodrow Wilson and other Progressives, had returned as an “immemorial problem” in need of foundations.  (I’ve often wondered in passing what Wilson and Oliver Wendell Holmes—an even greater enemy of natural rights—would have said about the Nuremberg trials had they lived long enough.  It wouldn’t have been pretty.)  To continue with Becker: “The incredible cynicism and brutality of Adolf Hitler’s ambitions, made every day more real by the servile and remorseless activities of his bleak-faced, humorless Nazi supporters, have forced men everywhere to re-appraise the validity of half-forgotten ideas, and enabled them once more to entertain convictions as to the substance of things not evident to the senses.” Why were those ideas “half-forgotten”?  Because of lazy historicist liberals like Becker himself.  The same kind of people who educated Obama.

                                                           (Paul Mirengoff) Obamacare tech chief  Henry Chao testified today that up to 40 percent of IT systems required to support the federal exchange still must be built.  Chao’s testimony was somewhat confusing, but I gather from his remarks and from  reports about what HHS sources are saying that the unbuilt portions center around the financial management tool and, in particular, the mechanism for transmitting federal subsidies to insurers. Apparently, this element may not be operational for two months. That’s well after the deadline for being enrolled in time to comply with the requirement of having coverage by January 1. The irony here is hard to miss.  The folks entitled to subsidies are the “winners” on the exchange.  Their premiums are too high, like those of everyone else on the exchange, but they are due subsidies to offset their inflated premium payments.   But now it looks like these subsidies may not be paid to the insurer in time for coverage to kick in by the date folks are required to be covered.  So those who like their new insurance plan may not get their new insurance plan, at least not in time.  This could produce some rude surprises.  One insurance industry source told Politico that “people may think they are enrolled [but] they are not.  They may show up at the doctor’s office and not be covered.” I guess we can call these folks low information patients.   If this scenario comes to pass, it shouldn’t take many anecdotes to raise the Obamacare scandal to a new level.\n",

                                                                           (Paul Mirengoff)  The Washington Post reports that Paul Ryan, in many ways the most appealing and credible GOP presidential contender/pretender, has turned his focus to fighting poverty.  Following in the footsteps of his mentor Jack Kemp, Ryan has been visiting inner-city neighborhoods accompanied by the estimable conservative anti- poverty crusader Robert Woodson. In addition, Ryan’s staff is working with center-right think tanks to develop ideas to replace the top-down, bureaucrat-centric approach to poverty favored by the left.  Apparently, Ryan would like to use the 50th anniversary of Lyndon Johnson’s 1964 unveiling of the War on Poverty (an occasion better forgotten in some ways) to roll out his own anti-poverty agenda. The Post’s story is short on specifics about what that agenda might look like.  It claims, plausibly, that Ryan himself so far has offered few of them.  From what I gather, we’re talking about a tax incentive here and there and some support for what Bush 41 used to call “a thousand points of light.” If the subject is compassionate conservatism, Michael Gerson can’t be far away.  Today he is only a few Washington Post pages away, as he devotes  his op-ed to discussing the newly revealed compassionate conservatism of Tea Party stalwart Sen. Mike Lee, another attractive presidential contender/pretender. Lee too now favors a “comprehensive anti-poverty, upward-mobility agenda”.  He calls for limited but energic government action to promote the compassionate work of civil society and to encourage economic opportunity.   As for specifics, Gerson says that Lee favors increasing the child tax credit, promoting flextime, and building transportation infrastructure.  That’s not a “comprehensive anti-poverty, upward- mobility agenda,” but Gerson tells us that Lee’s program is “only half formed.” What should we make of this?  First, it is good politics.  George W. Bush was right to talk up compassionate conservatism.  “Message, I care” is a good, winning message, so long as one doesn’t announce that it is a message, as his father once did.  That message, better packaged, was a key to the son’s narrow victory in 2000. Many Republicans forgot this reality following the fall from grace of Bush 43 and the victory of a non-compassion talking GOP in 2010.  I received plenty of pushback when I reminded a conservative dinner gathering of it in the heady days of early 2011.  But the electorate has now issued the same reminder, and some of the brighter GOP leaders have taken note. Politics aside, there is merit in some of compassionate conservatism’s agenda.  And I’m a  long-time fan of Bob Woodson. But “compassionate conservative” is not a viable poverty-fighting program, and should not be held out as such.  Accordingly, Paul Ryan would jeopardize his well-earned reputation for seriousness if he were to invite comparison between his compassionate agenda and LBJ’s war on poverty. Poverty can be significantly reduced, consistent with conservative principles, through economic growth — a rising tide will lift most non-leaky boats — coupled with a revival of the traditional family — the great preventative of leaky boats. Saying so may make a politician sound too much like a cross between Mitt Romney and Rick Santorum, both of whom turned out to be presidential pretenders.  Hence the temptation to say other things. That temptation need not be resisted, as long as one remembers that, between them, Romney and Santorum got it basically right.\n",

The State Department has designated Al-Shabab as a terrorist group and alleged that it has links to Al-Qaida.  Coincidentally, the Los Angeles Times has a brief article bearing on this aspect of the problem.  Richard Serrano reports “Americans radicalized by al Qaeda are a big concern” — they’re a big concern not at the Star Tribune, or in the offices of Amy Klobuchar or Al Franken or Keith Ellison, but over at the FBI.  Serrano reports:  Federal law enforcement officials say they have been tracing other U.S. residents traveling abroad, specifically Somali Americans from Minnesota who have gone to fight in that country. They are also watching several individuals identified soon after the Sept. 11 attacks, such as half a dozen men from the Buffalo suburb of Lackawanna, N.Y., who trained at an Al Qaeda facility in Afghanistan. Comey says these suspects are always the most difficult to identify and stop. He suggests it is all the more challenging today because Al Qaeda has been “metastasizing” into splinter groups in Iraq, Syria and Libya. Although the FBI previously had “great success” against Al Qaeda in the group’s traditional Afghanistan-Pakistan region, he said, “in the ungoverned or poorly governed spaces in Africa and around the Middle East, we see a resurgence of Al Qaeda affiliates.  I’ve written several times about Minnesota’s large and growing Somali population. I repeat myself a lot on the subject and am repeating myself here.   Minnesota is home to the largest Somali community in the United States. We know amazingly little about the them, probably because we are afraid to ask the relevant questions. We know they are mostly Muslim — we can see the hijabs, we are familiar with the many local controversies to which their faith has given rise over the past 10 years — but are they loyal residents or citizens of the United States? In the conflict between the United States and the Islamist forces with which we are contending, whose side are they on? The Star Tribune has never looked even an inch below the surface to examine the relevant questions or render the appropriate findings. As only Peter Bergen recalls in the current context, it is a proven fact that al Shabab has received financial support in addition to manpower from Minnesota Somalis. In the National Affairs essay “The Muslim-American muddle” Peter Skerry expressly raised the question of loyalty in the context of America’s Muslim population in general.  The essay is by turns infuriating and illuminating, but at least it licensed inquiry into the question. Indeed, Skerry took the question seriously and provided evidence supporting the concerns of “alarmists,”  noting the striking absence of any acknowledged tie to the United States on the part of important Muslim organizations.  Skerry contrasted “complacent elites” with “alarmist populists.”  I would place Skerry on the complacent side of the divide and myself on the alarmist side, although Skerry placed himself (of course) in the middle as the voice of reason mediating between the two camps.  But Skerry concludes the essay on what I would characterize as an alarmist (i.e., realistic) note.   Along the way, Skerry seemed to me to treat several basic issues (including assimilation) in a conclusory and question-begging fashion.  He cited the naturalization of Muslim immigrants and their involvement in American politics, supporting Democrats, as factors supporting (I will say) complacency.  Yet the two defendants in the Minneapolis terror trial were both naturalized citizens.  And CAIR has formed a fruitful alliance with Democrats going back to its days as a Hamas front group (Skerry suggests that those days are behind it).  Skerry rightly observed: “It is astonishing, given th[e history of CAIR], that the mainstream American media should routinely describe CAIR as ‘a Muslim civil rights organization.’”    Skerry failed to raise the question whether the immigration spigot should remain open while we sort out the serious issues that he addressed in his essay.  The question didn’t even seem to cross his mind.  In any event, Skerry’s essay badly needs to be updated, but we will, not surprisingly, have to look for help from places other than the the Star Tribune.\n",
       "1624    (Scott Johnson) When Martin Luther King, Jr., brought his nonviolent campaign against segregation to Bull Connor’s Birmingham, he laid siege to the bastion of Jim Crow. In Birmingham between 1957 and 1962, black homes and churches had been subjected to a series of horrific bombings intended to terrorize the community. In April 1963 King answered the call to bring his campaign to Birmingham. When King landed in jail on Good Friday for violating an injunction prohibiting demonstrations, he took the opportunity to meditate on the counsel of prudence with which Birmingham’s white ministers had greeted his campaign. King’s “Letter from Birmingham Jail” was the result. Reading the “Letter” fifty years later is a humbling experience. Perhaps most striking is King’s seething anger over the indignities of segregation:  I guess it is easy for those who have never felt the stinging darts of segregation to say, “Wait.” But when you have seen vicious mobs lynch your mothers and fathers at will and drown your sisters and brothers at whim; when you have seen hate filled policemen curse, kick, brutalize and even kill your black brothers and sisters with impunity; when you see the vast majority of your twenty million Negro brothers smothering in an airtight cage of poverty in the midst of an affluent society; when you suddenly find your tongue twisted and your speech stammering as you seek to explain to your six-year-old daughter why she can’t go to the public amusement park that has just been advertised on television, and see tears welling up in her eyes when she is told that Funtown is closed to colored children, and see the depressing clouds of inferiority begin to form in her little mental sky, and see her begin to distort her little personality by unconsciously developing a bitterness toward white people; when you have to concoct an answer for a five-year-old son asking in agonizing pathos: “Daddy, why do white people treat colored people so mean?”; when you take a cross-country drive and find it necessary to sleep night after night in the uncomfortable corners of your automobile because no motel will accept you; when you are humiliated day in and day out by nagging signs reading “white” and “colored”; when your first name becomes “nigger,” your middle name becomes “boy” (however old you are) and your last name becomes “John,” and your wife and mother are never given the respected title “Mrs.”; when you are harried by day and haunted by night by the fact that you are a Negro, living constantly at tip-toe stance never quite knowing what to expect next, and plagued with inner fears and outer resentments; when you are forever fighting a degenerating sense of “nobodiness”; then you will understand why we find it difficult to wait. There comes a time when the cup of endurance runs over, and men are no longer willing to be plunged into an abyss of despair. I hope, sirs, you can understand our legitimate and unavoidable impatience.  In addition to King’s witness, King’s prophetic call permeates the “Letter.” Why did King presume to come from Atlanta to Birmingham? King writes:  I am in Birmingham because injustice is here. Just as the eighth century prophets left their little villages and carried their “thus saith the Lord” far beyond the boundaries of their home towns; and just as the Apostle Paul left his little village of Tarsus and carried the gospel of Jesus Christ to practically every hamlet and city of the Graeco-Roman world, I too am compelled to carry the gospel of freedom beyond my particular home town. Like Paul, I must constantly respond to the Macedonian call for aid. King’s prophetic call must have been both a source of strength and of concern. His strength was manifest; he rarely let his concern show. Perfection is not a condition of the prophet’s call, and King was both imperfect and aware of his imperfections. His unbending strength is all the more remarkable. It is difficult to comprehend that King was only 39 years old at the time of his assassination in Memphis on April 4, 1968, or that the prospect of his death weighed so heavily on his mind. He seems too young to have accomplished so much, or to have maintained his judgment under such trying circumstances. The magnitude of his own trials must have had a deep impact on him. In the speech he gave in Memphis the day before his assassination, he movingly recalled his first confrontation with death:  You know, several years ago, I was in New York City autographing the first book that I had written. And while sitting there autographing books, a demented black woman came up. The only question I heard from her was, “Are you Martin Luther King?” And I was looking down writing, and I said yes. And the next minute I felt something beating on my chest. Before I knew it I had been stabbed by this demented woman. I was rushed to Harlem Hospital. It was a dark Saturday afternoon. And that blade had gone through, and the X-rays revealed that the tip of the blade was on the edge of my aorta, the main artery. And once that’s punctured, you drown in your own blood — that’s the end of you. It came out in the New York Times the next morning, that if I had sneezed, I would have died. Well, about four days later, they allowed me, after the operation, after my chest had been opened, and the blade had been taken out, to move around in the wheel chair in the hospital. They allowed me to read some of the mail that came in, and from all over the states, and the world, kind letters came in. I read a few, but one of them I will never forget. I had received one from the President and the Vice-President. I’ve forgotten what those telegrams said. I’d received a visit and a letter from the Governor of New York, but I’ve forgotten what the letter said. But there was another letter that came from a little girl, a young girl who was a student at the White Plains High School. And I looked at that letter, and I’ll never forget it. It said simply, “Dear Dr. King: I am a ninth-grade student at the White Plains High School.” She said, “While it should not matter, I would like to mention that I am a white girl. I read in the paper of your misfortune, and of your suffering. And I read that if you had sneezed, you would have died. And I’m simply writing you to say that I’m so happy that you didn’t sneeze.”  Here he paused to look back on what he had achieved with the time he had been granted:  And I want to say tonight, I want to say that I am happy that I didn’t sneeze. Because if I had sneezed, I wouldn’t have been around here in 1960, when students all over the South started sitting-in at lunch counters. And I knew that as they were sitting in, they were really standing up for the best in the American dream. And taking the whole nation back to those great wells of democracy which were dug deep by the Founding Fathers in the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution. If I had sneezed, I wouldn’t have been around in 1962, when Negroes in Albany, Georgia, decided to straighten their backs up. And whenever men and women straighten their backs up, they are going somewhere, because a man can’t ride your back unless it is bent. If I had sneezed, I wouldn’t have been here in 1963, when the black people of Birmingham, Alabama, aroused the conscience of this nation, and brought into being the Civil Rights Bill. If I had sneezed, I wouldn’t have had a chance later that year, in August, to try to tell America about a dream that I had had. If I had sneezed, I wouldn’t have been down in Selma, Alabama, been in Memphis to see the community rally around those brothers and sisters who are suffering. I’m so happy that I didn’t sneeze. Looking beyond his accomplishments, he likened himself to Moses, the prophet par excellence, and testified to the source of the prophet’s voice:  Well, I don’t know what will happen now. We’ve got some difficult days ahead. But it doesn’t matter with me now. Because I’ve been to the mountaintop. And I don’t mind. Like anybody, I would like to live a long life. Longevity has its place. But I’m not concerned about that now. I just want to do God’s will. And He’s allowed me to go up to the mountain. And I’ve looked over. And I’ve seen the promised land. I may not get there with you. But I want you to know tonight, that we, as a people, will get to the promised land. And I’m happy, tonight. I’m not worried about anything. I’m not fearing any man. Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord.  (First posted on Martin Luther King Day 2005.) UPDATE 2011: Dr. Art Fougner writes from Forest Hills to note: “Recently, our Medical Society of the County of Queens honored Dr. John W. Cordice with the Lifetime Achievement Award. Dr. Cordice was a young surgeon on duty at Harlem Hospital when Dr. King was brought in with his near fatal injury and was one of the team that saved his life. Thought you’d appreciate the circle’s being completed.” Dr. Fougner is past president of the society.\n",
