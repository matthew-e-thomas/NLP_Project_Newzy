Old timers of Paso Robles wines all know the Dusi name.  The Dusi family’s Zinfandel vineyards go back nearly a century.  For decades, if you wanted to find the best Zinfandels from the region, you wanted to find who bought the Dusi crop for that year.  The Dusi family seldom made their own wine—until now.  And here’s the four-minute storyboard for it.  (Footnote: I’ve met Janell Dusi a couple of times, and always said, “When are you guys going to start keeping your own grapes for yourselves?”  The time has come.) if(typeof(jQuery)==\"function\"){(function($){$.fn.fitVids=function(){}})(jQuery)};jwplayer('jwplayer-2').setup({\"aspectratio\":null,\"width\":580,\"height\":326,\"primary\":\"html5\",\"logo\":{\"file\":\"http://www.powerlineblog.com/pl_vid_bug_BW.png\",\"hide\":false,\"link\":\"http://www.powerlineblog.com\",\"position\":\"top-left\"},\"file\":\"http://youtu.be/efAbsW8KXn8\"});  We’ve also fallen behind with the latest from the Paso Wine Man, who offers up a defense of the much-maligned Merlot.  (I’ll add that I’m hugely thankful that Sideways was filmed down in Santa Barbara County rather than San Luis Obispo county, lest my favorite haunts be overrun with casual drinkers like SB County now is.) if(typeof(jQuery)==\"function\"){(function($){$.fn.fitVids=function(){}})(jQuery)};jwplayer('jwplayer-3').setup({\"aspectratio\":null,\"width\":580,\"height\":326,\"primary\":\"html5\",\"logo\":{\"file\":\"http://www.powerlineblog.com/pl_vid_bug_BW.png\",\"hide\":false,\"link\":\"http://www.powerlineblog.com\",\"position\":\"top-left\"},\"file\":\"http://youtu.be/eTr2erWTjgE\"});</td>\n",

       "      <td>(John Hinderaker) At least I think it was the Onion. Someone, anyway, got access to the Times Editorial Board computers and turned out this parody editorial on Obamacare: Congressional Republicans have stoked consumer fears and confusion with charges that the health care reform law is causing insurers to cancel existing policies and will force many people to pay substantially higher premiums next year for coverage they don’t want. That, they say, violates President Obama’s pledge that if you like the insurance you have, you can keep it. Mr. Obama clearly misspoke when he said that. HaHaHaHaHa! President Obama misspoke 27 times! And curiously enough, when he misspoke it was the centerpiece of his argument for his supposedly signature legislative achievement! Even the Times editorial board wouldn’t try to sell that one; it’s got to be the Onion. By law, insurers cannot continue to sell policies that don’t provide the minimum benefits and consumer protections required as of next year. So they’ve sent cancellation notices to hundreds of thousands of people who hold these substandard policies. Sure! From now on you can pay extra for pediatric dental coverage, even if you don’t have any kids! (At issue here are not the 149 million people covered by employer plans, but the 10 million to 12 million people who buy policies directly on the individual market.) Here the Onion goes too far. It can’t expect us to believe that the Times editorial board is so ill-informed that it doesn’t realize we are talking about employer-sponsored group plans. As we wrote here, the Obama administration itself calculated, back in 2010, that more than one-half of all employer-sponsored plans will be dropped once Obamacare goes into effect. And that is just in the short term; in the long run, the Obama administration acknowledged that all current plans will be phased out and those covered by them will have to pay more, in some cases with help from the taxpayers or Chinese banks. Still, every good parody goes over the top at some point. Well done, Onion!</td>\n",

They are the centerpiece of our Lies of Obamacare series of posts, most recently featuring John’s important contribution.  Today Kyle Smith devotes a New York Post column to the lie that has consumed our attention over the past week or two.  Smith’s column puts an exclamation point on the exposure of Obama’s calculated deceit:  On June 15, 2009, Obama said, in one of hundreds of similar statements, “No matter how we reform health care, we will keep this promise to the American people: If you like your doctor, you will be able to keep your doctor, period. If you like your health-care plan, you’ll be able to keep your health-care plan, period. No one will take it away, no matter what.” This wasn’t just bulls – – t. This was a lie.  Smith column concludes:  There is no escape. What Obama said wasn’t true and that’s all there is to it. To the American public, he is a different man than he was last week. People can handle bulls – – t, but not dishonesty. We don’t like that. His approval rating touched an all-time low this week in the NBC/WSJ poll, and that was before his deception became the news of the week. Obama has rebranded himself as a liar, forever. He will carry this new label to his grave.  Whole thing here.</td>\n",

Old timers of Paso Robles wines all know the Dusi name.  The Dusi family’s Zinfandel vineyards go back nearly a century.  For decades, if you wanted to find the best Zinfandels from the region, you wanted to find who bought the Dusi crop for that year.  The Dusi family seldom made their own wine—until now.  And here’s the four-minute storyboard for it.  (Footnote: I’ve met Janell Dusi a couple of times, and always said, “When are you guys going to start keeping your own grapes for yourselves?”  The time has come.) if(typeof(jQuery)==\"function\"){(function($){$.fn.fitVids=function(){}})(jQuery)};jwplayer('jwplayer-2').setup({\"aspectratio\":null,\"width\":580,\"height\":326,\"primary\":\"html5\",\"logo\":{\"file\":\"http://www.powerlineblog.com/pl_vid_bug_BW.png\",\"hide\":false,\"link\":\"http://www.powerlineblog.com\",\"position\":\"top-left\"},\"file\":\"http://youtu.be/efAbsW8KXn8\"});  We’ve also fallen behind with the latest from the Paso Wine Man, who offers up a defense of the much-maligned Merlot.  (I’ll add that I’m hugely thankful that Sideways was filmed down in Santa Barbara County rather than San Luis Obispo county, lest my favorite haunts be overrun with casual drinkers like SB County now is.) if(typeof(jQuery)==\"function\"){(function($){$.fn.fitVids=function(){}})(jQuery)};jwplayer('jwplayer-3').setup({\"aspectratio\":null,\"width\":580,\"height\":326,\"primary\":\"html5\",\"logo\":{\"file\":\"http://www.powerlineblog.com/pl_vid_bug_BW.png\",\"hide\":false,\"link\":\"http://www.powerlineblog.com\",\"position\":\"top-left\"},\"file\":\"http://youtu.be/eTr2erWTjgE\"});   \n",
       "           49      (John Hinderaker) At least I think it was the Onion. Someone, anyway, got access to the Times Editorial Board computers and turned out this parody editorial on Obamacare: Congressional Republicans have stoked consumer fears and confusion with charges that the health care reform law is causing insurers to cancel existing policies and will force many people to pay substantially higher premiums next year for coverage they don’t want. That, they say, violates President Obama’s pledge that if you like the insurance you have, you can keep it. Mr. Obama clearly misspoke when he said that. HaHaHaHaHa! President Obama misspoke 27 times! And curiously enough, when he misspoke it was the centerpiece of his argument for his supposedly signature legislative achievement! Even the Times editorial board wouldn’t try to sell that one; it’s got to be the Onion. By law, insurers cannot continue to sell policies that don’t provide the minimum benefits and consumer protections required as of next year. So they’ve sent cancellation notices to hundreds of thousands of people who hold these substandard policies. Sure! From now on you can pay extra for pediatric dental coverage, even if you don’t have any kids! (At issue here are not the 149 million people covered by employer plans, but the 10 million to 12 million people who buy policies directly on the individual market.) Here the Onion goes too far. It can’t expect us to believe that the Times editorial board is so ill-informed that it doesn’t realize we are talking about employer-sponsored group plans. As we wrote here, the Obama administration itself calculated, back in 2010, that more than one-half of all employer-sponsored plans will be dropped once Obamacare goes into effect. And that is just in the short term; in the long run, the Obama administration acknowledged that all current plans will be phased out and those covered by them will have to pay more, in some cases with help from the taxpayers or Chinese banks. Still, every good parody goes over the top at some point. Well done, Onion!   \n",

They are the centerpiece of our Lies of Obamacare series of posts, most recently featuring John’s important contribution.  Today Kyle Smith devotes a New York Post column to the lie that has consumed our attention over the past week or two.  Smith’s column puts an exclamation point on the exposure of Obama’s calculated deceit:  On June 15, 2009, Obama said, in one of hundreds of similar statements, “No matter how we reform health care, we will keep this promise to the American people: If you like your doctor, you will be able to keep your doctor, period. If you like your health-care plan, you’ll be able to keep your health-care plan, period. No one will take it away, no matter what.” This wasn’t just bulls – – t. This was a lie.  Smith column concludes:  There is no escape. What Obama said wasn’t true and that’s all there is to it. To the American public, he is a different man than he was last week. People can handle bulls – – t, but not dishonesty. We don’t like that. His approval rating touched an all-time low this week in the NBC/WSJ poll, and that was before his deception became the news of the week. Obama has rebranded himself as a liar, forever. He will carry this new label to his grave.  Whole thing here.   \n",

                                                (Steven Hayward) I’ve been falling behind on many regular features these days, among them, the Power Line 100, but also the crucial subject of wine.  So here’s a quick catch up guide. Old timers of Paso Robles wines all know the Dusi name.  The Dusi family’s Zinfandel vineyards go back nearly a century.  For decades, if you wanted to find the best Zinfandels from the region, you wanted to find who bought the Dusi crop for that year.  The Dusi family seldom made their own wine—until now.  And here’s the four-minute storyboard for it.  (Footnote: I’ve met Janell Dusi a couple of times, and always said, “When are you guys going to start keeping your own grapes for yourselves?”  The time has come.) if(typeof(jQuery)==\"function\"){(function($){$.fn.fitVids=function(){}})(jQuery)};jwplayer('jwplayer-2').setup({\"aspectratio\":null,\"width\":580,\"height\":326,\"primary\":\"html5\",\"logo\":{\"file\":\"http://www.powerlineblog.com/pl_vid_bug_BW.png\",\"hide\":false,\"link\":\"http://www.powerlineblog.com\",\"position\":\"top-left\"},\"file\":\"http://youtu.be/efAbsW8KXn8\"});  We’ve also fallen behind with the latest from the Paso Wine Man, who offers up a defense of the much-maligned Merlot.  (I’ll add that I’m hugely thankful that Sideways was filmed down in Santa Barbara County rather than San Luis Obispo county, lest my favorite haunts be overrun with casual drinkers like SB County now is.) if(typeof(jQuery)==\"function\"){(function($){$.fn.fitVids=function(){}})(jQuery)};jwplayer('jwplayer-3').setup({\"aspectratio\":null,\"width\":580,\"height\":326,\"primary\":\"html5\",\"logo\":{\"file\":\"http://www.powerlineblog.com/pl_vid_bug_BW.png\",\"hide\":false,\"link\":\"http://www.powerlineblog.com\",\"position\":\"top-left\"},\"file\":\"http://youtu.be/eTr2erWTjgE\"});\n",

Someone, anyway, got access to the Times Editorial Board computers and turned out this parody editorial on Obamacare: Congressional Republicans have stoked consumer fears and confusion with charges that the health care reform law is causing insurers to cancel existing policies and will force many people to pay substantially higher premiums next year for coverage they don’t want. That, they say, violates President Obama’s pledge that if you like the insurance you have, you can keep it. Mr. Obama clearly misspoke when he said that. HaHaHaHaHa! President Obama misspoke 27 times! And curiously enough, when he misspoke it was the centerpiece of his argument for his supposedly signature legislative achievement! Even the Times editorial board wouldn’t try to sell that one; it’s got to be the Onion. By law, insurers cannot continue to sell policies that don’t provide the minimum benefits and consumer protections required as of next year. So they’ve sent cancellation notices to hundreds of thousands of people who hold these substandard policies. Sure! From now on you can pay extra for pediatric dental coverage, even if you don’t have any kids! (At issue here are not the 149 million people covered by employer plans, but the 10 million to 12 million people who buy policies directly on the individual market.) Here the Onion goes too far. It can’t expect us to believe that the Times editorial board is so ill-informed that it doesn’t realize we are talking about employer-sponsored group plans. As we wrote here, the Obama administration itself calculated, back in 2010, that more than one-half of all employer-sponsored plans will be dropped once Obamacare goes into effect. And that is just in the short term; in the long run, the Obama administration acknowledged that all current plans will be phased out and those covered by them will have to pay more, in some cases with help from the taxpayers or Chinese banks.

They are the centerpiece of our Lies of Obamacare series of posts, most recently featuring John’s important contribution.  Today Kyle Smith devotes a New York Post column to the lie that has consumed our attention over the past week or two.  Smith’s column puts an exclamation point on the exposure of Obama’s calculated deceit:  On June 15, 2009, Obama said, in one of hundreds of similar statements, “No matter how we reform health care, we will keep this promise to the American people: If you like your doctor, you will be able to keep your doctor, period. If you like your health-care plan, you’ll be able to keep your health-care plan, period. No one will take it away, no matter what.” This wasn’t just bulls – – t. This was a lie.  Smith column concludes:  There is no escape. What Obama said wasn’t true and that’s all there is to it. To the American public, he is a different man than he was last week. People can handle bulls – – t, but not dishonesty. We don’t like that. His approval rating touched an all-time low this week in the NBC/WSJ poll, and that was before his deception became the news of the week. Obama has rebranded himself as a liar, forever. He will carry this new label to his grave.  Whole thing here.\n",

                      (Scott Johnson) It’s unfair to compare and contrast Barack Obama with commercial pitchmen hawking their wares, even if the goods do not conform to unqualified representations of fact.  James Taranto explains why.  Whereas a scammer selling shoddy goods is breaking the law, Obama defrauded the public to make Obamacare the law.  “Thus there is no evident legal recourse for those who were injured by Obama’s fraudulent promise…” Nevertheless, ABC News has compiled a clip allowing us to measure Obama against some of the “most recognizable TV hawkers.”  With its mocking comparison, the clip is perhaps most interesting for the irreverent attitude it displays (following the obligatory commercial).

Policy Polling ran a survey here in Minnesota that was reported on in today’s St. Paul Pioneer Press. The political results were predictably dreary; both Mark Dayton and Al Franken are favored for re-election, in part because hardly anyone has heard of any of their prospective GOP opponents. But for some reason, PPP also asked some sports questions, and they found an interesting split with regard to the Minnesota Vikings’ current quarterback controversy. Let’s back up. Two years ago, the Vikings were awful, finishing 3-13. Last year, they surprised everyone by going 10-6 and making the post-season, with Christian Ponder, who played well down the stretch, at the helm. This year the team is off to a poor start, currently 1-6. Ponder started the season at QB; Matt Cassel, a career back-up, has started one game–the only one the Vikings have won so far–and the team signed Josh Freeman when Freeman was cut by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Freeman has started one game, just days after he joined the team. He clearly was not in command of the offense, and looked awful. He also suffered a mild concussion in that game, which put Ponder back in the starting role. So here in Minnesota, we have a quarterback controversy, which is another way of saying we don’t have a very good quarterback. They don’t have quarterback controversies in New England or Denver. With that background, here are PPP’s findings: Ponder is the top QB choice among Republicans, with 34 percent of those polled, while Democrats prefer Josh Freeman, who got 30 percent of those polled. Let’s acknowledge up front that we are dealing at the margin of statistical significance. That said, the question is intriguing: why would Republicans tend to favor Ponder, and Democrats Freeman? Christian Ponder There is one obvious, stereotypical explanation: Republicans favor the guy who has had some success and is a known commodity. Democrats prefer to throw a hail-Mary on a guy who has only played one game, did a pretty horrible job, but has a strong arm and maybe some yet-unseen up-side. That could be the explanation. Josh Freeman But I suspect that something else is going on. It is striking, if you live here in Minnesota and especially if you read comments on stories in the Minneapolis Star Tribune sports pages, how some people hate Christian Ponder. They don’t just think he isn’t a very good quarterback; they don’t merely think he doesn’t have a very good arm. They hate him. Literally. Why? The only analogy I can think of is the way many liberals hate Tim Tebow. As it happens, Christian Ponder is a mini-Tebow. His parents weren’t kidding when they named him. As you might know, he married ESPN football reporter Samantha Steele last year. In this interview, he described Samantha as “a true woman of God.” Those are not, to be honest, the words that occurred to me when I first saw Ms. Steele. There are a number of other religious references in that interview, and most others Ponder has done. Samantha Ponder Is that why some–not all, by any means, but some–Democrats hate Ponder? I suspect that it is. Many liberals, maybe most, are actively anti-religious. They are engaged in a campaign to drive any positive references to religion out of the public sphere. A man like Christian Ponder, in that context, is beyond the pale. They hate him. I would like to be wrong, but I suspect that is what explains the partisan division in Minnesota’s quarterback controversy. For what it is worth, I am not a big pro football fan, but I will be rooting for Ponder and the Vikings tomorrow against the Dallas Cowboys.\n",

Government presumably is capable, at some point, of running a web site. It is the cancellation notices going out to millions of Americans that define the true Obamacare battle lines. We see here a naked exercise of state power, facilitated–not coincidentally–by state lies. It was always necessary that you should lose your insurance coverage, or, at a minimum, pay more for it; otherwise the whole Obamacare scheme would not work. And what we have seen so far is only the tip of the iceberg. In 2010, the Obama administration acknowledged, in the Federal Register, that pretty much everyone who has employer-sponsored insurance will lose their existing plans before long. So the cancellation notices have only just begun. This should be a learning moment for the American people. The great thing about freedom is that for the most part, you can do what you want. The trouble with statism is that someone is always telling you what to do, and that person doesn’t care about you or your family, and probably doesn’t like you much. There was a time when everyone knew this, but if it really has been forgotten by many Americans, Obamacare has come along at an opportune time. A reader writes: Obamacare is ripping off the mask of liberalism to reveal the totalitarian snarl behind Big Brother’s smile. “Million Dollar” Bill Maher — as cynical, obnoxious and contemptuous an Obama operative as can be found — does us all a huge service by openly reveling in Obamaland’s foundational lies. Since you’re too stupid and vicious even to know what’s good for you, let alone what the “public good” is, it is perfectly OK that we’re lying to you repeatedly…you deserve it! You’re welcome. “Million Dollar” Bill is very helpful here in identifying the rottenness of the central conceit of the New Class entitlement/regulatory state. Maher is right–the political arts are inherently those of deception, force, lies, hidden agendas, false promises and misdirection at a level that is simply not tolerable or even possible in ordinary life, especially in economic activity. This is exactly why we should severely limit the scope of politics and political processes in our lives to the bare minimum of real public goods. The fiasco of Obamacare has exposed this dichotomy like nothing else. An elite of intellectually dishonest political power mongers in a deceitful and corrupt process, purports to arrogate to themselves decisions about who can be lied to and dragooned into supporting and subsidizing what favored groups.   Unlike in commercial transactions where the lowliest consumer can choose to play or not, and can “exit” if he doesn’t like an actor’s offerings, when the state in involved you have no “exit”: they have law and force on their side. Oh, sure, you have a “voice.” You have the very political processes so aptly described by “Million Dollar” Bill filtered by a corrupt, supine and collusive MSM…one vote out of millions…with a premium on the rhetorical arts of misdirection. The liberal entitlement/regulatory state wants to subject as much of your life as possible to political processes, controlled by the New Class…with only your “voice” as a check, not an “exit”. The ugly reality behind their actions and motives is now exposed and the repercussions from this episode are just beginning to be felt. The principles behind Obamacare could easily be applied more widely. We could have Obamafood, for example. Everyone could be issued a card that contains data on his income; when you go to the grocery store, the card is scanned and a price generated. “That chicken will cost you $32.50 per pound, sir.” Or, “Congratulations! Those Pop Tarts are free!” Which is to say that someone else paid for them. We could have Obamacars–everyone is required to buy an expensive car, loaded up with purported safety devices manufactured by Democratic Party contributors, and how much you pay depends on how much money you earn. After all, lots of people will need subsidies to buy those expensive vehicles. And that is only the beginning! Obamahouses, Obamaclothes–why not? If the state knows best, there is no reason not to go all the way. Which, in one way or another, is what liberals have in mind. The battle over Obamacare is a clarifying moment. It will tell us whether the spirit of liberty is still alive in America.\n",

Mike Rogers’ questioning of Kathleen Sebelius was a highlight  of her appearance before the House Ways and Means Committee last Wednesday.  Rogers used his questions to show that codes on the Obamacare website are constantly being “swapped,” and that as a result, the security of the system can’t properly be tested and the personnel information supplied by those who use it isn’t secure.   Rogers is Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee.  When it comes to cyber-security issues, he knows what he’s talking about.  Sebelius was unable to answer Rogers’ questions of fact, much less address his concerns.    Today, as  John Fund reports, Rogers appeared on CBS’s Face the Nation, and called on the Obama administration to shut down the Obamacare site for security reasons:  They need to take the site down, stabilize it, meaning they can’t continue to add code every week, and then they need to stress test the system.  Unfortunately, none of that has happened.  And they admit it’s going to take six months. . . . .That is unacceptable for the protection of privacy of Americans’ information.  Before the White House dismisses Rogers’ statement as a case of partisan politics, it should consider this:  Dianne Feinstein, the liberal Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee said basically the same thing on the same program.  Feinstein told host Bob Schieffer:  I felt and I said this directly to the president’s chief of staff, that they ought to take down the website until it was right. They believe that they need to keep it running and that they can sort out the difficulties.  Fund reports points out that both Rogers and Feinstein have had private briefings on the security weaknesses of Healthcare.gov.  Their comments on CBS today show that the White House has been unable to assuage their concerns.  Clearly, the Obama administration places its political fears ahead of valid privacy concerns expressed by two senior members of Congress (one a Republican, the other a Democrat) with considerable relevant expertise.  But then, as the  Washington Post reported today, the Obama administration’s political fears go a long way towards explaining the failed launch of its Obamacare website.\n",

                                                                                                                                  (Paul Mirengoff) Fifty years ago, when the idea still seemed novel and overly intrusive, conservatives sometimes complained that the welfare state aimed to take care of Americans “from the cradle to the grave.”  These days, however, the government is taking care of many Americans even after they reach the grave. The  Washington Post reports that “in the past few years, Social Security has paid $133 million to beneficiaries who [are] deceased.”  In addition, the federal retirement system has paid more than $400 million to retirees who have passed away.  And one federal aid program spent nearly $4 million to pay heating and air-conditioning bills for more 11,000 dead people.  As far as we know, however, the feds haven’t paid for phone calls made by the dead.   This wouldn’t be our federal government if it didn’t screw up both coming and going.  Thus, the Post reports that the feds falsely list as dead at least 750 new people per month.  And, adds the Post, “once you are on this list, it’s not easy to get off.” In fairness, it can’t be easy to keep track of all American deaths with complete accuracy (but neither can it be easy to invent 750 deaths per month).  After all, approximately 2.5 million Americans die each year. But having researched the matter, the Post’s David Fahrenthold concludes that payments to the dead at the current order of magnitude could be avoided.  “For government watchdogs,” he writes, “these are some of the most fixable — and therefore the most maddening — mistakes that the government makes.” The government, Fahrenthold finds, has simply neglected to fix the problem mainly because the money being doled out to the dead is other peoples’ money.  But this is probably not the sole explanation.  The feds had plenty of incentive to design a workable Obamacare website, yet lacked the competence to do so.   The same problems — lack of concern and lack of competence — plague the welfare state throughout its cradle-to-grave jurisdiction.  Which suggests to me that this jurisdiction should be rolled back.\n",

media and the liberal establishment (but. . . oh, you know the rest) is gearing up rapidly for the 50th anniversary of the assassination of John F. Kennedy later this month.  Already we’re seeing some of the usual themes recycled: Kennedy was a wonderboy whose unlimited capacities would have ended the Cold War, achieved racial harmony, cured cancer, and delivered us into the land of milk and honey forever, but for the reactionary atmosphere in Dallas that somehow led a pro-Castro Communist to shoot him in cahoots with the CIA and the mob. That last detail—that Oswald was a Communist—never seems to cause even the slightest hesitation in the liberal narrative, but at least recent polls are showing a steady decline in the number of people who believe a (Oliver) Stoned view of the matter. If you really want to get the counternarrative, you have to read James Piereson’s fine book Camelot and the Cultural Revolution: How the Assassination of John F. Kennedy Shattered American Liberalism.  But if you live in the Boulder area, you can hear Piereson speak in person on the topic this Wednesday at 6:30 pm in the Old Main Chapel on the CU Boulder campus (I’ll be hosting and introducing him).  You can read the full details here. In one sentence, Piereson’s thesis is that liberals evaded the simplest truth about Kennedy’s killing: “President Kennedy was a victim of the Cold War.”  Piereson’s teaching: “The assassination of a popular president by a Communist should have generated a revulsion against everything associated with left wing doctrines. Yet something close to the opposite happened. In the aftermath of the assassination, left wing ideas and revolutionary leaders, Marx, Lenin, Mao, and Castro foremost among them, enjoyed a greater vogue in the United States than at any time in our history.” Piereson argues convincingly that it was the reaction to the assassination itself, within the mainstream American establishment as well as among liberal intellectuals, that caused liberalism essentially to suffer a nervous breakdown in the years that followed.

                 (Scott Johnson) Edie Littlefield Sundby is in a life and death struggle with stage 4 gallbladder cancer.  She has defied the odds so far with the assistance of a world-class medical team paid for by a United Healthcare Group individual health policy.  She writes in the Wall Street Journal, however, that her luck may have just run out.  Her “affordable, lifesaving medical insurance policy has been canceled effective Dec. 31.”  It is gone with Obama’s promise that if she likes her plan, she can keep it.  Unfortunately, she is unable to find a suitable replacement.  Now what? if(typeof(jQuery)==\"function\"){(function($){$.fn.fitVids=function(){}})(jQuery)};jwplayer('jwplayer-2').setup({\"aspectratio\":null,\"width\":580,\"height\":326,\"primary\":\"html5\",\"logo\":{\"file\":\"http://www.powerlineblog.com/pl_vid_bug_BW.png\",\"hide\":false,\"link\":\"http://www.powerlineblog.com\",\"position\":\"top-left\"},\"file\":\"http://youtu.be/FoIgxb7ylbg\"});  Looking around on the Internet for a photo of Ms. Sundby to accompany this post, I found the video above  dating from earlier this year.  She tells the story of her struggle to that point. if(typeof(jQuery)==\"function\"){(function($){$.fn.fitVids=function(){}})(jQuery)};jwplayer('jwplayer-3').setup({\"aspectratio\":null,\"width\":580,\"height\":326,\"primary\":\"html5\",\"logo\":{\"file\":\"http://www.powerlineblog.com/pl_vid_bug_BW.png\",\"hide\":false,\"link\":\"http://www.powerlineblog.com\",\"position\":\"top-left\"},\"file\":\"http://youtu.be/L1NMRjakmtw\"});  In the video above she pays tribute to her “Band of Angels.”  In the text accompanying the video she writes: “I feel enormous joy and gratitude to be alive. For 6 years I have fought Stage 4 gall bladder cancer with the help of God, family, friends, doctors, nurses, and legions of angels in the backfield. This video is dedicated to the Band of Angels who have been there every step of the way – praying, treating, supporting, and loving.”  Now she needs one more angel over her shoulder.\n",

gabfest, I wondered: Who is Pfeiffer and why is he talking so fast?  Pfeiffer, it turns out, is Assistant to the President and Senior Advisor to the President for Strategy and Communications.  Pfeiffer helpfully explicated the foundational lie of Obamacare about keeping your health insurance if you like it: “If you had your plan and it hasn’t been changed or canceled, you can keep it.”  Thanks, man, I really appreciate it. Watching this segment yesterday, one other question occurred to me: What did the president know and when did he know it?  I suppose we’ll get to the bottom of this obvious question around the time we hear from the American survivors of the Benghazi attack. The Wall Street Journal made some progress in answering that question over the weekend in an article behind the Journal’s subscription paywall.  The Journal article is discussed by Newbusters’ Tom Blumer here.  Stephanopoulos quotes from the Journal article in the windup to his question for Pfeiffer. So why is Pfeiffer talking so fast?  It might come naturally to him, but over in Strategy and Communication you must learn that the ability to talk fast can come in really, really handy.

The losers will consist mainly of middle class Americans, whose party allegiance is split.”        This piece in Politico supports my assessment.  It focuses on the initial wave of Obamacare losers, namely those who have lost their privately purchased health insurance and are thus forced, if they wish to remain insured, to purchase an Obamacare approved plan.   According to Politico writers Darren Samuelsohn and Jason Millman, between 10 and 20 million Americans have purchased health insurance on their own.  The Obama administration itself has  projected that most of them will lose that insurance.    Samuelsohn and Millman contend that these “Obamacare losers could pack a political punch.”  If anything, though, their description of the cohort — “married, older, white, college-educated, GOP-leaning Americans” — tends to understate that punch by implying that the disaffected are mostly natural Republicans anyway.    But later in the article we learn that, according to a survey by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, nearly half of those who brought their own insurance are between the ages of 18 and 44.  We also learn, thanks to a poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation, that there is no statistically significant difference between the political party affiliation of those who buy their own health care.   To be sure, when pressed, more people in this group say they lean Republican than Democrat.  But the Kaiser poll clearly supports my statement that the party allegiance of Obamacare losers (at least this set of them) is split.  Moreover, as one analyst quoted by Politico says, anger over cancellation letters is likely to cross party lines. The big question, of course, is how this anger will translate on Election Day 2014.  Apparently, there are not yet any data out there that help answer this question.  But Samuelsohn and Millman clearly believe that anger over insurance cancellations caused by Obamacare might well translate into serious problems for the Democrats.    It’s the shock of the change — especially after President Barack Obama repeatedly promised that anyone could keep the plan that they had — that is very real and threatens to resonate through the 2014 midterm campaign. “[Obama] may have known this is a more sophisticated issue – you’re going to get better, more benefits – but people who hear politicians are very literal,” said Harvard professor Bob Blendon, an expert on public attitudes toward health care policy.  Again, Samuelsohn and Millman understate the problem for Democrats.  It’s not just shock in the abstract, coupled with Obama’s broken promise, that is driving anger.  Nor is the anger due to lack of sophistication.  Kaiser found that, on average, purchasers of private insurance pay an average premium of $385, with a $3,754 average deductible.  If the reporting on the exchanges is anywhere close to accurate, these folks are not finding plans this economically desirable under Obamacare.  Rather, the plans they find are like ones they rejected, or never even considered, pre-Obamacare.   Moreover, folks are unlikely to be moved by claims that they are losing nothing more than “bad apple” insurance that can be replaced by a better plan with more benefits are.  Kaiser found that nearly everyone who buys private insurance shops first.  Most are unlikely to regard the insurance they selected after doing their homework — and rejecting plans with more forms of coverage — as rotten. It is true that some who lose their private plans will be eligible for subsidies.  But the polling cited by Politico show that most are too well-off for that. To make matters worse for the Democrats, Politico also suggests that the class angered as a result of folks losing their private insurance won’t be limited to the victims themselves.    “For every one person who gets their policy cancelled, that fact could influence maybe three or four other voters as well. It has a potential to spiral to not just people it immediately affects, but others,” said David Hogberg, a health care policy analyst for the National Center for Public Policy Research, a conservative think tank.  Finally, I should note,  as John has, that those who lose coverage under a private plan represent just the tip of the iceberg of Obamacare losers.  The Obama administration has calculated that half of all employer plans will be terminated as a result of Obamacare.   The class of Obamacare losers created by this wave of cancellations isn’t likely to be any better amused than the class created by the initial wave.  And the second wave will be greater in magnitude and longer in duration.\n",

provided more revelations about Obamacare, and in particular, the healthcare.gov web site. As Paul noted, tech chief Henry Chao testified as much as 40 percent of the IT systems required to support the federal exchange do not yet exist. Beyond that, serious questions were raised about the web site’s security, and a March report by McKinsey came to light that suggested the Obama administration had ample notice that healthcare.gov would not be ready for prime time. I don’t know how many McKinsey reports you have seen; I have read quite a few of them, as they often surface in civil litigation. In my experience, they tend to be heavily bureaucratic but with flashes of color of the sort that trial lawyers like. You can read McKinsey’s report on the progress of healthcare.gov here. It doesn’t take much reading between the lines to figure out that the Obamacare web site was in deep trouble. I like this page, which contrasts the way a massive project of this sort should be carried out with the way the Obama administration was developing healthcare.gov:  A fair paraphrase would be: You, President Obama, are doing every single thing wrong. While the web site issues give rise to an entirely appropriate sense of schadenfreude, they are of relatively little importance. I assume that eventually, by brute force and the expenditure of billions of dollars, the administration will be able to create a web portal that more or less functions. But the real problems with Obamacare have little or nothing to do with the web site; they have everything to do with the substance of the law. The first wave of revulsion occurred when it became evident that millions of Americans in the individual and small group markets were losing their health insurance, contrary to the Democrats’ oft-repeated promise that if you like your health insurance, you can keep it. The falsity of that promise has dealt a devastating and well-deserved blow to Barack Obama’s credibility, and the lie will haunt every Democratic Senator or Congressman who runs for reelection next year.  For the next year or more there will be a rolling fiasco as millions of Americans lose their coverage not only in the individual market, but in the employer-sponsored market that covers most people. The Obama administration predicted in 2010 that over half of all Americans who have employer-sponsored group plans will lose them during Obamacare’s first year; those tens of millions of people will be distinctly unhappy. That will be the second wave of disgust with Obamacare. The third wave of revulsion will overlap with the second; it will come when people realize–again, in both the individual market and the employer-sponsored market–that Obamacare has made their health insurance coverage more expensive. President Obama’s promise that the average family will save $2,500 annually in insurance premiums is an absurdity. Anyone with any sense can see that Obamacare will be more expensive than what came before, not less expensive. The $2,500 promise will soon be as notorious as the “if you like your insurance, you can keep it” pledge. The only ones who save money will be those who are heavily subsidized by their neighbors. They will be ashamed to admit who they are. This disaster will unfold inexorably. It has nothing to do with the web site; rather, it is the intended consequence of the Democrats’ plan. All Republicans need to do is stay out of the way as Obamacare implodes and drives Democrats from office. When Democrats plead for help in “fixing” Obamacare on a bipartisan basis, Republicans must just say No.\n",

No sensible person disputes that we work out our ideas in space and time with great difficulty, but Obama’s use of “may” is extremely telling, like the academics I meet who unfailing say “Lincoln was right—for his time.”  What about our time, today?  What about Lincoln’s view that the self-evident truths of the Declaration were true everywhere and always, as Jefferson put it?  I’d bet a lot of money that Obama does not believe that.  Does Joel really believe differently about Obama’s deepest philosophical views?  Why would Obama believe differently?  It is the overwhelming teaching of the ivy leagues where Obama marinated.  (And I believe a close reading of his 2008 Philadelphia speech on race fully bears this out.) To be sure, I discover that most liberals, when pressed, repudiate their historicism and moral relativism instantly.  How else to criticize genocide in Darfur, which criticism violates all of the simpleminded canons of “multiculturalism”?  But liberals are typically unable to give any coherent account of the ground of their moral sanctions, which is why modern liberalism appears more often as sheer willfulness. Liberals like the Gettysburg Address mostly because of its flowery rhetoric.  Conservatives who like it (which is not all conservatives—an important point for another time) do so because they think it is true.  On this occasion of the 150th anniversary of the Gettysburg Address, it may be useful to take in one of Harry Jaffa’s meditations on the problem: Confronted with a statement of principles beginning “We hold these truth to be self-evident,” most writers, even the most learned, assume that what follows are merely the subjective opinions of a bygone age, possessing no more truth for us than anything else that may be agreeable to our passions.  From this perspective, there can be no ground for denying that justice is the interest of the stronger, in the sense that Thrasymachus originally intended.  From this perspective, Socrates may remain forever in the Piraeus, but there will be no dialogue on justice. Jaffa always liked to point to Carl Becker’s otherwise fine 1922 book on the Declaration of Independence, still the best book on the Declaration in many respects, for expressing the modern liberal sensibility that Obama surely shares, when Becker wrote: “To ask whether the natural rights philosophy of the Declaration of Independence is true or false is essentially a meaningless question.”  Meaningless, because, for Becker, Darwin had shown us the mutability of all nature, including human nature.  The faith of the founders, Becker concluded, “could not survive the harsh realities of the modern world.” And yet, when Becker reissued his book in the fall of 1941—in the shadow of the European and soon to be American war—he struck a very different note in a new introduction: “[It] may be thought that just now, when political freedom, already lost in many countries, is everywhere threatened, the readers of books would be more than ordinarily interested in the political principles of the Declaration of Independence.  Certainly recent events throughout the world have aroused an unwonted attention to the immemorial problem of human liberty.” Suddenly, in the newly extreme circumstances of 1941—the latest “harsh reality of the modern world” to quote Becker—the older principles of liberty, taken for granted as obsolete and superseded by Woodrow Wilson and other Progressives, had returned as an “immemorial problem” in need of foundations.  (I’ve often wondered in passing what Wilson and Oliver Wendell Holmes—an even greater enemy of natural rights—would have said about the Nuremberg trials had they lived long enough.  It wouldn’t have been pretty.)  To continue with Becker: “The incredible cynicism and brutality of Adolf Hitler’s ambitions, made every day more real by the servile and remorseless activities of his bleak-faced, humorless Nazi supporters, have forced men everywhere to re-appraise the validity of half-forgotten ideas, and enabled them once more to entertain convictions as to the substance of things not evident to the senses.” Why were those ideas “half-forgotten”?  Because of lazy historicist liberals like Becker himself.  The same kind of people who educated Obama.

federal exchange still must be built.  Chao’s testimony was somewhat confusing, but I gather from his remarks and from  reports about what HHS sources are saying that the unbuilt portions center around the financial management tool and, in particular, the mechanism for transmitting federal subsidies to insurers. Apparently, this element may not be operational for two months. That’s well after the deadline for being enrolled in time to comply with the requirement of having coverage by January 1. The irony here is hard to miss.  The folks entitled to subsidies are the “winners” on the exchange.  Their premiums are too high, like those of everyone else on the exchange, but they are due subsidies to offset their inflated premium payments.   But now it looks like these subsidies may not be paid to the insurer in time for coverage to kick in by the date folks are required to be covered.  So those who like their new insurance plan may not get their new insurance plan, at least not in time.  This could produce some rude surprises.  One insurance industry source told Politico that “people may think they are enrolled [but] they are not.  They may show up at the doctor’s office and not be covered.” I guess we can call these folks low information patients.   If this scenario comes to pass, it shouldn’t take many anecdotes to raise the Obamacare scandal to a new level.\n",

                                                                                         (Paul Mirengoff)  The Washington Post reports that Paul Ryan, in many ways the most appealing and credible GOP presidential contender/pretender, has turned his focus to fighting poverty.  Following in the footsteps of his mentor Jack Kemp, Ryan has been visiting inner-city neighborhoods accompanied by the estimable conservative anti- poverty crusader Robert Woodson. In addition, Ryan’s staff is working with center-right think tanks to develop ideas to replace the top-down, bureaucrat-centric approach to poverty favored by the left.  Apparently, Ryan would like to use the 50th anniversary of Lyndon Johnson’s 1964 unveiling of the War on Poverty (an occasion better forgotten in some ways) to roll out his own anti-poverty agenda. The Post’s story is short on specifics about what that agenda might look like.  It claims, plausibly, that Ryan himself so far has offered few of them.  From what I gather, we’re talking about a tax incentive here and there and some support for what Bush 41 used to call “a thousand points of light.” If the subject is compassionate conservatism, Michael Gerson can’t be far away.  Today he is only a few Washington Post pages away, as he devotes  his op-ed to discussing the newly revealed compassionate conservatism of Tea Party stalwart Sen. Mike Lee, another attractive presidential contender/pretender. Lee too now favors a “comprehensive anti-poverty, upward-mobility agenda”.  He calls for limited but energic government action to promote the compassionate work of civil society and to encourage economic opportunity.   As for specifics, Gerson says that Lee favors increasing the child tax credit, promoting flextime, and building transportation infrastructure.  That’s not a “comprehensive anti-poverty, upward- mobility agenda,” but Gerson tells us that Lee’s program is “only half formed.” What should we make of this?  First, it is good politics.  George W. Bush was right to talk up compassionate conservatism.  “Message, I care” is a good, winning message, so long as one doesn’t announce that it is a message, as his father once did.  That message, better packaged, was a key to the son’s narrow victory in 2000. Many Republicans forgot this reality following the fall from grace of Bush 43 and the victory of a non-compassion talking GOP in 2010.  I received plenty of pushback when I reminded a conservative dinner gathering of it in the heady days of early 2011.  But the electorate has now issued the same reminder, and some of the brighter GOP leaders have taken note. Politics aside, there is merit in some of compassionate conservatism’s agenda.  And I’m a  long-time fan of Bob Woodson. But “compassionate conservative” is not a viable poverty-fighting program, and should not be held out as such.  Accordingly, Paul Ryan would jeopardize his well-earned reputation for seriousness if he were to invite comparison between his compassionate agenda and LBJ’s war on poverty. Poverty can be significantly reduced, consistent with conservative principles, through economic growth — a rising tide will lift most non-leaky boats — coupled with a revival of the traditional family — the great preventative of leaky boats. Saying so may make a politician sound too much like a cross between Mitt Romney and Rick Santorum, both of whom turned out to be presidential pretenders.  Hence the temptation to say other things. That temptation need not be resisted, as long as one remembers that, between them, Romney and Santorum got it basically right.\n",

The State Department has designated Al-Shabab as a terrorist group and alleged that it has links to Al-Qaida.  Coincidentally, the Los Angeles Times has a brief article bearing on this aspect of the problem.  Richard Serrano reports “Americans radicalized by al Qaeda are a big concern” — they’re a big concern not at the Star Tribune, or in the offices of Amy Klobuchar or Al Franken or Keith Ellison, but over at the FBI.  Serrano reports:  Federal law enforcement officials say they have been tracing other U.S. residents traveling abroad, specifically Somali Americans from Minnesota who have gone to fight in that country. They are also watching several individuals identified soon after the Sept. 11 attacks, such as half a dozen men from the Buffalo suburb of Lackawanna, N.Y., who trained at an Al Qaeda facility in Afghanistan. Comey says these suspects are always the most difficult to identify and stop. He suggests it is all the more challenging today because Al Qaeda has been “metastasizing” into splinter groups in Iraq, Syria and Libya. Although the FBI previously had “great success” against Al Qaeda in the group’s traditional Afghanistan-Pakistan region, he said, “in the ungoverned or poorly governed spaces in Africa and around the Middle East, we see a resurgence of Al Qaeda affiliates.  I’ve written several times about Minnesota’s large and growing Somali population. I repeat myself a lot on the subject and am repeating myself here.   Minnesota is home to the largest Somali community in the United States. We know amazingly little about the them, probably because we are afraid to ask the relevant questions. We know they are mostly Muslim — we can see the hijabs, we are familiar with the many local controversies to which their faith has given rise over the past 10 years — but are they loyal residents or citizens of the United States? In the conflict between the United States and the Islamist forces with which we are contending, whose side are they on? The Star Tribune has never looked even an inch below the surface to examine the relevant questions or render the appropriate findings. As only Peter Bergen recalls in the current context, it is a proven fact that al Shabab has received financial support in addition to manpower from Minnesota Somalis. In the National Affairs essay “The Muslim-American muddle” Peter Skerry expressly raised the question of loyalty in the context of America’s Muslim population in general.  The essay is by turns infuriating and illuminating, but at least it licensed inquiry into the question. Indeed, Skerry took the question seriously and provided evidence supporting the concerns of “alarmists,”  noting the striking absence of any acknowledged tie to the United States on the part of important Muslim organizations.  Skerry contrasted “complacent elites” with “alarmist populists.”  I would place Skerry on the complacent side of the divide and myself on the alarmist side, although Skerry placed himself (of course) in the middle as the voice of reason mediating between the two camps.  But Skerry concludes the essay on what I would characterize as an alarmist (i.e., realistic) note.   Along the way, Skerry seemed to me to treat several basic issues (including assimilation) in a conclusory and question-begging fashion.  He cited the naturalization of Muslim immigrants and their involvement in American politics, supporting Democrats, as factors supporting (I will say) complacency.  Yet the two defendants in the Minneapolis terror trial were both naturalized citizens.  And CAIR has formed a fruitful alliance with Democrats going back to its days as a Hamas front group (Skerry suggests that those days are behind it).  Skerry rightly observed: “It is astonishing, given th[e history of CAIR], that the mainstream American media should routinely describe CAIR as ‘a Muslim civil rights organization.’”    Skerry failed to raise the question whether the immigration spigot should remain open while we sort out the serious issues that he addressed in his essay.  The question didn’t even seem to cross his mind.  In any event, Skerry’s essay badly needs to be updated, but we will, not surprisingly, have to look for help from places other than the the Star Tribune.\n",
       "            1624      (Scott Johnson) When Martin Luther King, Jr., brought his nonviolent campaign against segregation to Bull Connor’s Birmingham, he laid siege to the bastion of Jim Crow. In Birmingham between 1957 and 1962, black homes and churches had been subjected to a series of horrific bombings intended to terrorize the community. In April 1963 King answered the call to bring his campaign to Birmingham. When King landed in jail on Good Friday for violating an injunction prohibiting demonstrations, he took the opportunity to meditate on the counsel of prudence with which Birmingham’s white ministers had greeted his campaign. King’s “Letter from Birmingham Jail” was the result. Reading the “Letter” fifty years later is a humbling experience. Perhaps most striking is King’s seething anger over the indignities of segregation:  I guess it is easy for those who have never felt the stinging darts of segregation to say, “Wait.” But when you have seen vicious mobs lynch your mothers and fathers at will and drown your sisters and brothers at whim; when you have seen hate filled policemen curse, kick, brutalize and even kill your black brothers and sisters with impunity; when you see the vast majority of your twenty million Negro brothers smothering in an airtight cage of poverty in the midst of an affluent society; when you suddenly find your tongue twisted and your speech stammering as you seek to explain to your six-year-old daughter why she can’t go to the public amusement park that has just been advertised on television, and see tears welling up in her eyes when she is told that Funtown is closed to colored children, and see the depressing clouds of inferiority begin to form in her little mental sky, and see her begin to distort her little personality by unconsciously developing a bitterness toward white people; when you have to concoct an answer for a five-year-old son asking in agonizing pathos: “Daddy, why do white people treat colored people so mean?”; when you take a cross-country drive and find it necessary to sleep night after night in the uncomfortable corners of your automobile because no motel will accept you; when you are humiliated day in and day out by nagging signs reading “white” and “colored”; when your first name becomes “nigger,” your middle name becomes “boy” (however old you are) and your last name becomes “John,” and your wife and mother are never given the respected title “Mrs.”; when you are harried by day and haunted by night by the fact that you are a Negro, living constantly at tip-toe stance never quite knowing what to expect next, and plagued with inner fears and outer resentments; when you are forever fighting a degenerating sense of “nobodiness”; then you will understand why we find it difficult to wait. There comes a time when the cup of endurance runs over, and men are no longer willing to be plunged into an abyss of despair. I hope, sirs, you can understand our legitimate and unavoidable impatience.  In addition to King’s witness, King’s prophetic call permeates the “Letter.” Why did King presume to come from Atlanta to Birmingham? King writes:  I am in Birmingham because injustice is here. Just as the eighth century prophets left their little villages and carried their “thus saith the Lord” far beyond the boundaries of their home towns; and just as the Apostle Paul left his little village of Tarsus and carried the gospel of Jesus Christ to practically every hamlet and city of the Graeco-Roman world, I too am compelled to carry the gospel of freedom beyond my particular home town. Like Paul, I must constantly respond to the Macedonian call for aid. King’s prophetic call must have been both a source of strength and of concern. His strength was manifest; he rarely let his concern show. Perfection is not a condition of the prophet’s call, and King was both imperfect and aware of his imperfections. His unbending strength is all the more remarkable. It is difficult to comprehend that King was only 39 years old at the time of his assassination in Memphis on April 4, 1968, or that the prospect of his death weighed so heavily on his mind. He seems too young to have accomplished so much, or to have maintained his judgment under such trying circumstances. The magnitude of his own trials must have had a deep impact on him. In the speech he gave in Memphis the day before his assassination, he movingly recalled his first confrontation with death:  You know, several years ago, I was in New York City autographing the first book that I had written. And while sitting there autographing books, a demented black woman came up. The only question I heard from her was, “Are you Martin Luther King?” And I was looking down writing, and I said yes. And the next minute I felt something beating on my chest. Before I knew it I had been stabbed by this demented woman. I was rushed to Harlem Hospital. It was a dark Saturday afternoon. And that blade had gone through, and the X-rays revealed that the tip of the blade was on the edge of my aorta, the main artery. And once that’s punctured, you drown in your own blood — that’s the end of you. It came out in the New York Times the next morning, that if I had sneezed, I would have died. Well, about four days later, they allowed me, after the operation, after my chest had been opened, and the blade had been taken out, to move around in the wheel chair in the hospital. They allowed me to read some of the mail that came in, and from all over the states, and the world, kind letters came in. I read a few, but one of them I will never forget. I had received one from the President and the Vice-President. I’ve forgotten what those telegrams said. I’d received a visit and a letter from the Governor of New York, but I’ve forgotten what the letter said. But there was another letter that came from a little girl, a young girl who was a student at the White Plains High School. And I looked at that letter, and I’ll never forget it. It said simply, “Dear Dr. King: I am a ninth-grade student at the White Plains High School.” She said, “While it should not matter, I would like to mention that I am a white girl. I read in the paper of your misfortune, and of your suffering. And I read that if you had sneezed, you would have died. And I’m simply writing you to say that I’m so happy that you didn’t sneeze.”  Here he paused to look back on what he had achieved with the time he had been granted:  And I want to say tonight, I want to say that I am happy that I didn’t sneeze. Because if I had sneezed, I wouldn’t have been around here in 1960, when students all over the South started sitting-in at lunch counters. And I knew that as they were sitting in, they were really standing up for the best in the American dream. And taking the whole nation back to those great wells of democracy which were dug deep by the Founding Fathers in the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution. If I had sneezed, I wouldn’t have been around in 1962, when Negroes in Albany, Georgia, decided to straighten their backs up. And whenever men and women straighten their backs up, they are going somewhere, because a man can’t ride your back unless it is bent. If I had sneezed, I wouldn’t have been here in 1963, when the black people of Birmingham, Alabama, aroused the conscience of this nation, and brought into being the Civil Rights Bill. If I had sneezed, I wouldn’t have had a chance later that year, in August, to try to tell America about a dream that I had had. If I had sneezed, I wouldn’t have been down in Selma, Alabama, been in Memphis to see the community rally around those brothers and sisters who are suffering. I’m so happy that I didn’t sneeze. Looking beyond his accomplishments, he likened himself to Moses, the prophet par excellence, and testified to the source of the prophet’s voice:  Well, I don’t know what will happen now. We’ve got some difficult days ahead. But it doesn’t matter with me now. Because I’ve been to the mountaintop. And I don’t mind. Like anybody, I would like to live a long life. Longevity has its place. But I’m not concerned about that now. I just want to do God’s will. And He’s allowed me to go up to the mountain. And I’ve looked over. And I’ve seen the promised land. I may not get there with you. But I want you to know tonight, that we, as a people, will get to the promised land. And I’m happy, tonight. I’m not worried about anything. I’m not fearing any man. Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord.  (First posted on Martin Luther King Day 2005.) UPDATE 2011: Dr. Art Fougner writes from Forest Hills to note: “Recently, our Medical Society of the County of Queens honored Dr. John W. Cordice with the Lifetime Achievement Award. Dr. Cordice was a young surgeon on duty at Harlem Hospital when Dr. King was brought in with his near fatal injury and was one of the team that saved his life. Thought you’d appreciate the circle’s being completed.” Dr. Fougner is past president of the society.\n",

       "      <td>But how strong is the correlation between falling tax rates on the wealthiest among us and economic inequality? Plenty strong, according to a detailed analysis conducted by Andrew Fieldhouse for the Economic Policy Institute. After the jump we'll focus on the record of President Obama. Regarding Fieldhouse's conclusion and Barack Obama, first there is the stimulus package passed in 2009. Although its measures were temporary, there were a number of important ones—most notably those relating to the earned income tax credit—that did shift the tax burden in a more progressive direction. There were also the temporary increases in government spending that shifted money predominantly to those below the median income level (increased food stamp benefits, extended unemployment benefits, etc). But still, inequality has worsened during the president's first term, despite these measures. What about going forward? Also, two big sets of changes are hitting the federal tax code. Neither of them are surprises to anyone who follows politics, but I want to discuss them together, to assess their combined impact. On January 1, 2013, the federal marginal rate went up from 35 to 39.6% on income over $400,000 for individuals and $450,000 for married couples (indexed for inflation going forward). Additionally, people earning above those levels will see the tax they pay on capital gains and qualified dividends rise from 15% to 20%. No one else's tax rates went up. To be technical about it, President Obama signed into law an income tax cut for everyone below those levels. That's one major shift toward greater progressivity in the tax code. The other, more easily ignored shift results from Obamacare. Also as of this year, there is a 0.9 percent increase in Medicare taxes on income above $250,000 for married people filing jointly, $125,000 for married people filing separately, and $200,000 for everyone else. Additionally, people earning above those levels will pay a new Medicare tax of 3.8 percent on certain kinds of investment income. And where does this money go? It goes right out to people earning less than four times the poverty rate (about $46,000 for individuals and $94,000 for a family of four) as subsidies to help them pay for health insurance premiums. Additionally, Obamacare funds the expansion of Medicaid (most recently pushed through in Ohio) to millions of Americans who did not previously qualify. In other words the law directly attacks economic inequality, in addition to providing health insurance and, it appears thus far, reducing overall health care costs in America. These two major changes to the tax code have not kicked in yet. But once they do, they should have a significant impact on economic inequality. On their own, are they enough to reduce three and a half decades of damage caused by Reaganite thinking on taxes as well as globalization and the other factors driving that inequality? Of course not. But they will have a real and positive effect. Why am I writing about this now? Part of it relates to the rollout of Obamacare, and my thinking about its long-term impact. Was it the kind of health care reform I wanted? No. But it will help people, of that I have no doubt. Also, I was inspired to take on this topic after seeing the announcement of this coming Sunday's reader forum in the NYT. The forum asks for responses to an initial letter from someone who voted for Obama twice, but who is disappointed in what he's been able to achieve compared to other Democratic presidents such as FDR and LBJ. I take such concerns seriously, and by no means do I argue that Barack Obama has been a perfect president. As a historian, I recognize that comparisons across eras are tricky, to say the least. The New Deal and the Great Society, as well as LBJ's Civil Rights and Voting Rights laws, were tremendously important accomplishments. Without going into too much historical detail, I'll just say that I would have loved to see what Barack Obama could have done with a three-fourths Democratic majority in both houses of Congress like the one FDR had in his first two terms, or even the two thirds majority LBJ had after 1964. Also bear in mind the difference between today's Republicans—people who can't even stand to look at the president, and the Republicans of the past. Three-quarters of congressional Republicans voted for Social Security, and half of Congressional Republicans voted for Medicare (which Ronald Reagan claimed at the time would be the end of freedom for Pete's sake!). Barack Obama's 60 Senate Democrats in 2009-10 included one (Joe Lieberman) who threatened to filibuster, thus killing, health care reform if it included a public option. I'm not here to tear down the accomplishments of past liberal presidents. I'm also not here to say that Barack Obama is above criticism. We should criticize him, from his left, when he needs to act more vigorously in support of progressive goals. But we also need to recognize what he has accomplished as president. We have to be able to do both, because it does the progressive cause no good to engage either in blind hero worship or reflexive dismissal of real achievements. I chose to discuss income and wealth inequality because the fight against it stands at the center of the progressive movement. There is no other single issue that unites our cause quite so powerfully. The policies enacted by President Obama were not enough to stop economic inequality from worsening during his first term, although I don't even want to think about how much worse it would have gotten during the Great Recession without those policies. They did have a positive impact. But in the long run, the tax policies contained in the fiscal cliff deal and Obamacare discussed above should have even a greater effect on fighting economic inequality and thus strengthening our economy across the board. We cannot allow disillusionment over what we did not achieve to dull the energy we need to keep fighting. The extremists we are fighting against are simply too dangerous. And the people we are fighting for cannot afford us that indulgence.</td>\n",

       "      <td>The virulent meme spread across our nation with increasing frequency by Republicans and their racist adherents is that \"anti-racism\" is a code for \"anti-white.\" This is part of a larger pattern of stigmatization of any groups or efforts made to address and redress the racial inequities we still face, and there are myriad variations on the theme, including \"reverse racism,\" \"reverse discrimination\" and \"playing the race card\" or simply a dismissal of anyone who attempts to combat racism by labeling them a racist. Far too frequently we see headlines blasting racist blatherings by Republican politicians and party officials, local, state and national, and their faithful followers repeat these falsities ad nauseam on internet forums, in LTE's, newspaper comments and in personal conversations among family, friends and co-workers. Just use your favorite search engine. It takes but a minute to turn up examples, which are distributed geographically: Texas Republican Official Peter Morrison Talks Secession, Reverse Racism (Jasper, Texas), GOP Rep. Goes on a Racial Rant (Montana), Racist Rant Gets GOP Chairman in Hot Water (Illinois). This claptrap has now made its way onto a billboard in Harrison, Arkansas. Since Daily Kos is a reality-based community, with a readership that has an interest in history, I thought it might be useful to discuss some of the facts with which you might wish to arm yourselves when confronted by this seemingly endless font of bigotry. This is in hopes that in some small way, when faced with any of these memes in the course of daily interactions, online or in real-life mode, you can at least put paid to a few of the most egregious lies and distortions. No guarantee that pushback will change the minds of die-hard bigots, but we never know when facts may fall onto fertile ground, so we need to keep pushing them. Follow me below the fold for more. The organization that takes the hardest hit from those who clearly want to distort its message and purpose is the venerable NAACP, the oldest of the nation's civil rights organizations. Headlines like, \"House freshman calls NAACP chief 'racist' in email\", \"Extremist Hate Group NAACP wants Robert E. Lee’s picture taken down in Florida\" (I'm not linking to the hate site that houses this gem) abound, and whoever the current head of both the national (currently Benjamin  Jealous, whose dad is white) or local NAACP groups is at the time, they are the target of warped Teapublican poutrages. Other newer organizations, like the Southern Poverty Law Center, garner their fair share of sewage from both racists and anti-semites alike, since they were founded by Morris Dees (who is not Jewish but is attacked as if he is), and Joseph J. Levin, Jr. I'm a card-carrying member of the NAACP and have always been fascinated by its history. The Race Riot of 1908 in Abraham Lincoln's hometown of Springfield, Illinois had highlighted the urgent need for an effective civil rights organization in the U.S. This event is often cited as the catalyst for the formation of the NAACP. Mary White Ovington, journalist William English Walling and Henry Moskowitz met in New York City in January 1909 and the NAACP was born. Solicitations for support went out to more than 60 prominent Americans, and a meeting date was set for February 12, 1909. This was intended to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the birth of President Abraham Lincoln, who emancipated enslaved African Americans. While the meeting did not take place until three months later, this date is often cited as the founding date of the organization. The NAACP was founded on February 12, 1909 by a diverse group composed of W. E. B. Du Bois, Ida B. Wells, Archibald Grimké, Henry Moskowitz, Mary White Ovington, Oswald Garrison Villard, William English Walling (the last son of a former slave-holding family),Florence Kelley, a social reformer and friend of Du Bois, and Charles Edward Russell, a renowned muckraker and close friend of Walling who helped plan the NAACP and served as acting chairman of the National Negro Committee (1909), a forerunner to the NAACP. On May 30, 1909, the Niagara Movement conference took place at New York City's Henry Street Settlement House, from which an organization of more than 40 individuals emerged, calling itself the National Negro Committee. Du Bois played a key role in organizing the event and presided over the proceedings. Also in attendance was African-American journalist and anti-lynching crusader Ida B. Wells-Barnett. At its second conference on May 30, 1910, members chose as the organization's name the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and elected its first officers, who were: ...On September 3, 1908 she read an article written by Republican William English Walling, also a Liberal, entitled \"Race War in the North\" in The Independent. Walling described a massive race riot directed at black residents in the hometown of Abraham Lincoln, Springfield, Illinois that led to seven deaths, the destruction of 40 homes and 24 businesses, and 107 indictments against rioters. Walling ended the article by calling for a powerful body of citizens to come to the aid of blacks. Ovington responded to the article by writing Walling and meeting at his apartment in New York City along with social worker Dr. Henry Moskowitz. The group decided to launch a campaign by issuing a call for a national conference on the civil and political rights of African-Americans on the centennial of Lincoln’s birthday, February 12, 1909... After the war, Ovington served the NAACP as board member, executive secretary and chairman. The NAACP fought a long legal battle against segregation and racial discrimination in housing, education, employment, voting and transportation. They appealed to the Supreme Court to rule that several laws passed by southern states were unconstitutional and won three important judgments between 1915-1923 concerning voting rights and housing...Ovington retired as a board member of the NAACP in 1947, ending 38 years of service with the organization. She died on July 15, 1951. In 1906, following a trip to Russia to report on the abortive Russian Revolution of 1905 he married Anna Strunsky, a Jewish immigrant and an aspiring novelist from San Francisco. In 1908 he published Russia's Message, a book inspired by the social unrest he and his wife had observed in Russia. In 1908 Walling and his wife went to Springfield, Illinois to investigate a race riot. As a result of their investigations, Walling wrote an article The Race War in the North for the September 3 issue of The Independent, in which he stated, “the spirit of the abolitionists, of Lincoln and Lovejoy, must be revived and we must come to treat the negro on a plane of absolute political and capitalist equality.” He also appealed for a “large and powerful body of citizens to come to their aid.” The article directly led to the founding of the NAACP. I always find it odd that no one on the right has ever accused me of being \"anti-black\" because of my membership to a whole range of mainly \"white\" organizations over the years, from the ACLU to the AARP. In fact, no one ever calls them \"white\" groups at all, they are just \"groups,\" because white is the norm that needs no descriptor in our society, one must add an adjective to describe anything else. I've voted for white presidents and white senators, attended mostly white colleges and universities, with the exception of Howard University in Washington, D.C. Howard, due to its history and founding purpose, is \"a historically black college\" (HBCU), which of course obfuscates the fact it has over the years graduated white students, especially from the medical school during a time when Ivy League med schools had a Jewish quota. Howard was founded by a white man—Oliver O. Howard, for whom it is named. I remember having a conversation with Harris Wofford during the time he was the president of SUNY Old Westbury, before he became a senator from Pennsylvania. He mentioned having attended Howard Law school. The history of the civil rights movement in this country is one that has been forged out of the activism of people of all backgrounds. I'm always surprised when people question me about my former membership in the Black Panther Party, assuming it was anti-white, simply because of it having \"black\" in the name, and its militancy. Yet anyone familiar with the history of the Rainbow Coalition forged by Fred Hampton knows that to be a lie as well. So next time you encounter someone, online or in real life, spreading faux propaganda about the NAACP or any anti-racist group, hit them with the facts. Better still, if you are white, why not join me in becoming a card-carrying NAACP member. Then you can show them your \"card\" for real.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Why are the plutocrats, with their great wealth and a political system more likely to listen to them anyway, losing some control to the populists? The answer lies in the particular nature of plutocratic political power in the 21st century and its limitations in a wired mass democracy. You did remember to fall back, right? That means you set your clocks one hour... uh, one hour... Anyway, come on in and see what the rest of punditry has to say. Dana Milbank shows that, if nothing else, the Tea Party is a great force for chaos. That was the day the commonwealth’s Republican Party took what had been a sure thing and instead allowed the tea party to give the Democrats an opening. Supporters of Cuccinelli, the state attorney general, had scrapped the GOP gubernatorial primary, which probably would have resulted in the nomination of Lt. Gov. Bill Bolling, a mainstream conservative who likely would have cruised to victory. But Cuccinelli’s supporters forced the party to cut the electorate out of the process, replacing the primary with a convention. There, a smaller number of tea party activists handed the nomination to Cuccinelli, a man so conservative he had supported legislation that would have allowed the banning of the pill and other forms of birth control. Kathleen Parker has some advice to her own party going into the next cycle of elections. Dear Ms. Know-It-All: It appears the witch Hillary Rodham Clinton is going to run for president. It makes my skin crawl to think of her and that husband of hers back in our White House, not to mention that they are Marxists like Obama and want to turn us into Sweden, for God’s sake. It’s not too soon for Republicans to marshal our forces for a little shock and awe when the Hildebeast finally announces. How can we stop her? Signed, A proud, God-fearing, right-wing wacko bird. Thank you for what seems to be your sincere interest in participating in our country’s health and welfare. And thanks, too, for contacting me, because you need to hear what I have to say. You might want to sit down for this. If you’re on anti-anxiety medication, all the better. ... To the larger point, you must stop witchifying this woman. She has one of the best résumés in the country, certainly compared to anyone who might challenge her. This doesn’t speak to her personality, which seems to aggravate a certain kind of male, or to her involvement with issues that have inspired legitimate criticism. But in hurling personal insults, you are hurting only yourself. The bully always looks worse than the bullied. In so doing, you not only seem juvenile but also look petty and bereft of substantive arguments. While you consider this assessment, imagine how much Hillary must welcome such school-yard taunts. P.S. I'm trying not to feel rather happy about the fact that I did not even know there was a \"Ms. Know-It-All.\"  Not enough Georgetown cocktail parties, I suppose. Ross Douthat compares casino gambling and marijuana legalization to the recent improvements in gay rights because, you know, sin. In 1990, casino gambling was still concentrated in Nevada and Atlantic City. ... Today 23 states have commercial casinos, and the old model of casino-going as a what-happens-in-Vegas excursion has given way to casino-going as routine entertainment. ... The marijuana revolution is arguably not so far advanced, since only two states, Washington and Colorado, are experimenting with outright legalization. ... public opinion on the issue has shifted about as fast as it has on gay marriage — from 32 percent support for legalization in 2002 to 58 percent in the latest Gallup poll. There are significant differences in the ways gambling and pot have won America. The spread of casinos has been more of a top-down phenomenon, driven by states seeking revenue and an industry that’s free with campaign contributions. The permissive turn on marijuana has been a more (if you will) grass-roots affair — driven by activists and artists, influenced by empathy for the terminally ill, and hastened by public exhaustion with the drug war. Nicholas Kristof tries to point out that behind the health care fight is... health care. No, far more serious is the kind of catastrophe facing people like Richard Streeter, 47, a truck driver and recreational vehicle repairman in Eugene, Ore. His problem isn’t Obamacare, but a tumor in his colon that may kill him because Obamacare didn’t come quite soon enough. Streeter had health insurance for decades, but beginning in 2008 his employer no longer offered it as an option.  ... Because he didn’t have health insurance, he put off going to the doctor.  ...  By September, Streeter couldn’t stand the pain any longer ... Streeter made the 100-mile drive to Dr. Gibson’s office in McMinnville, Ore. — and received devastating news. Dr. Gibson had found advanced colon cancer. “It was heartbreaking to see the pain on his face,” Dr. Gibson told me. “It got me very angry with people who insist that Obamacare is a train wreck, when the real train wreck is what people are experiencing every day because they can’t afford care.” Dr. Gibson says that Streeter is the second patient he has had this year who put off getting medical attention because of lack of health insurance and now has advanced colon cancer. So, to those Republicans protesting Obamacare: You’re right that there are appalling problems with the website, but they will be fixed. Likewise, you’re right that President Obama misled voters when he said that everyone could keep their insurance plan because that’s now manifestly not true (although they will be able to get new and better plans, sometimes for less money). But how about showing empathy also for a far larger and more desperate group: The nearly 50 million Americans without insurance who play health care Russian roulette as a result. FamiliesUSA, a health care advocacy group that supports Obamacare, estimated last year that an American dies every 20 minutes for lack of insurance. But insurers are not allowed to abandon enrollees. They must offer consumers options that do comply with the law, and they are scrambling to retain as many of their customers as possible with new policies that are almost certain to be more comprehensive than their old ones. Indeed, in all the furor, people forget how terrible many of the soon-to-be-abandoned policies were. Some had deductibles as high as $10,000 or $25,000 and required large co-pays after that, and some didn’t cover hospital care. Francis Clines reminds us that an awful anniversary is approaching. This is plainly so. The town was roiled anew by a newspaper article last month based on interviews with anonymous law enforcement workers offering fresh and painful details on the six-minute, 154-round onslaught from a troubled 20-year-old who murdered six adults as well with an assault rifle. A promised official state report on the shootings, which residents find puzzlingly overdue, will rake the emotional trauma again when it eventually comes out. ... The town is discovering what all scenes of American mass gun tragedy ultimately learn: the suffering lingers long and even compounds within communities yearning for recovery. The local Newtown Bee newspaper put it this way: “On some days it seems like the great tragedy Newtown suffered on 12/14 has created its own ever-expanding universe, surging out from a big bang amplified by cameras and microphones to places unknown.” Sorry, doc. Fred Pearce details how, despite climate change denier claims that increases in temperature can be blamed on the sun, we're actually in for a solar chill. Lockwood and his colleagues are reassessing the chances of this decline continuing over decades to become the first \"grand solar minimum\" for four centuries. During a grand minimum the normal 11-year solar cycle is suppressed and the sun has virtually no sunspots for several decades. This summer should have seen a peak in the number of sunspots, but it didn't happen. Lockwood thinks there is now a 25 per cent chance of a repetition of the last grand minimum, the late 17th century Maunder Minimum, when there were no sunspots for 70 years. ... The Maunder Minimum coincided with the worst European winters of the little ice age, a period lasting centuries when several regions around the globe experienced unusual cooling. Tree ring studies suggest it cooled the northern hemisphere by up to 0.4 °C. It is more likely that it will simply reduce the warming a little, and set us up for greater warming if it receded.</td>\n",

Alexander Vindman’s testimony on Trump’s Ukrainian dealings. His pathetic attempt at throwing doubt on Vindman’s loyalty to the United States was not well received by CNN host John Berman, but Duffy was only doing what the Republican complicity machine had concocted. Calling out the fact Vindman was born in the Ukraine (his family immigrated to the U.S. when he was three-years-old), did not go down well with much of anyone as Sean Duffy has about as much integrity as an old cobweb. Realizing that he needed to do something resembling damage control, Duffy went to his Twitter account to post this: Lt. Col. Vindman is an American war hero.  As I said clearly this morning on air Ã¢ÂÂI salute Mr. VindmanÃ¢ÂÂs service.Ã¢ÂÂ  My point is that Mr. Vindman is an unelected advisor, he gives ADVICE.  President Trump sets the policy. An interesting note here is that the fact that Mr. Vindman is a adviser who gives “ADVICE” is not a “point,” when you lead by questioning his loyalty. Anyway, Duffy’s tweet was very quickly ratioed* into the netherworld. Don't mind me I'm here for the ratio and comments. pic.twitter.com/rC0PtO4ebz Great American actor Jeffrey Wright dropped in to tell Duffy how he felt. Lev Parnas is an unelected advisor, too - to Trump. His mug shot's on the right. Better get your loyalties straight. pic.twitter.com/DCJxJH5hjJ And then there were the thoughts most of us had. You are such a scumbag. We all saw the clip.I've also reviewed your own military service.You have none. @CNN needs to fire you, yesterday. #FireSeanDuffy Fellow Wisconsin Representative Gwen Moore had some thoughts on Sean Duffy. Lt. Col. Vindman is a Purple Heart vet who is continuing his service by testifying about Trump's efforts to undermine the sanctity of U.S. elections.Meanwhile, Sean Duffy defends Trump, a fellow reality star, who used his official position as POTUS to seek personal gain. https://t.co/bdQCpEOniO And a little walk down memory lane for Dirtbag Duffy.

That’s $38 million as the strike closes schools for a ninth day. Not only that, the teachers point to nearly $100 million of costs that have been moved from the city budget to the schools budget. “The payment for police in our schools, $33 million, which has traditionally been paid for by the city, was shifted to the schools; a pension payment that has traditionally been paid for by the city has been shifted to the schools,” Chicago Teachers Union Vice President Stacy Davis-Gates told Chicago Tonight. “So you have nearly $100 million of cost-shift from the city to the school budget at a time when we need it, at a time when the city is now, clearly, balancing their budget on the backs of our students.” Another key issue is 30 minutes a day of prep time that elementary school teachers lost under former Mayor Rahm Emanuel. According to CTU, “Teachers used that time to contact parents, grade papers, prepare lesson plans and update curricula, reducing the amount of unpaid labor they put in outside of the work day. While CPS counts that half hour as ‘instructional minutes,’ for many teachers that time is spent wiping up spilled milk and cleaning up after students as they eat their breakfasts in the classrooms.” SEIU Local 73, which represents many school support staff from custodians to classroom assistants, has reached a tentative deal to end its strike, which started alongside the teachers strike. Meanwhile, over in Massachusetts, teachers in Dedham won an agreement and unanimously ratified it after just one weekday of strike. It was the first teachers strike in 12 years in the state, where public workers are legally prohibited from striking.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Ever wondered how, precisely, social movements lead to change? Ever wonder, for example, if a local march, rally, or movement can really change the way insider politics function? Can organizing really impact our laws and governance? Maurice Mitchell, the national director of the Working Families Party and a key leader in the Movement for Black Lives (the global network behind Black Lives Matter), broke down exactly why—and how—social movements can and do lead to tremendous change in politics. “What social movements do when they're at their best,” Mitchell explained to Daily Kos in an interview behind the scenes at Netroots Nation, the country’s largest conference for progressives, “is that they render the invisible visible, and they render the impossible possible.” One big example in the United States? The Black Lives Matter movement and the exposure it’s brought to police violence and, in particular, the violence against black men and black transgender women. It’s no surprise, then, that police violence is the issue that “transformed” Mitchell the most as an organizer. “One of our classmates was killed by an undercover police officer, and it mobilized and politicized many of my fellow classmates, and it certainly politicized me,” Mitchell recalled in reference to his college days. Since then, he said, “I've been committing all of my energy, all of my time, all of my passion to making sure that young people just like him won't also share his fate; that other black, brown and poor men and women could actually thrive in this country.” “It's a lot deeper than shoving somebody into a poll and getting them to pull a lever for a particular candidate,” Mitchell stressed. “It's about acquainting somebody with their innate power and acquainting them with the amazing transformational ability of collective power to change the world.” Feeling motivated yet? Check out Mitchell’s full interview below, where he talks to Daily Kos about how to mobilize potential voters, how the far right uses cynicism to their advantage, and how to inspire people to reach their own power. I've been organizing since I was a young person, but I think the issue that really transformed me the most was police violence. When I was still a very young person in college, one of our classmates was killed by an undercover police officer, and it mobilized and politicized many of my fellow classmates, and it certainly politicized me, and I began to organize direct actions. We held a huge, more than a thousand person direct action. We were in D.C., and we went to the Department of Justice, and after that particular organizing moment, I never looked back. And I've been committing all of my energy, all of my time, all of my passion to making sure that young people just like him won't also share his fate; that other black, brown and poor men and women could actually thrive in this country. We meet voters where they are by respecting with them, by being in conversation and relationship with them. I'm an organizer, so fundamentally I always look through the prism of relationships, right, and I think what has happened over time with our electoral politics is that it's become very corporate, very metrics-based, very sort of consultant-driven, right, and we've lost the heart and soul of our politics. Politics are ultimately about people, and politics is about some of the most intimate things in our lives … how our children are educated, whether or not I have meaningful health care, whether or not I live in a community where I can breathe fresh air. That's what politics are ultimately about. And so rooting it in those intimate conversations and relationships, and then presenting a vision that meets the scale of the problems that everyday working people are feeling. There's a reason why people have dropped out of our politics, because it doesn't align with their values, and it doesn't resonate with them. And also the conversation is happening in the air, outside of them, and so coming back to the basics of organizing is going to be key to mobilizing all of those folks that have dropped out of our politics but we desperately need not just to vote, but to be organized. And this is why that I as an organizer—like organizing is my religion, but why I put a primacy on organizing because organizing gets the goods every day, right? When you bring people together, and they're able to surface their own power and they're able to connect with one another, they're transformed by that work. And once they're transformed, just like me and my transformational experience as a young person, as a college student, once you're transformed by the work, you're forever transformed, right. So it's a lot deeper than shoving somebody into a poll and getting them to pull a lever for a particular candidate. It's about acquainting somebody with their innate power and acquainting them with the amazing transformational ability of collective power to change the world. I came from movement building and the Movement for Black Lives. And one of the things that I learned from that experience is that the power of social movements could really change the world. And what social movements do when they're at their best is that they render the invisible visible, and they render the impossible possible. So what do I mean by that? So social movements, let's take the Movement for Black Lives, render a reality that has been invisible in our society, the police killing of black folks and state violence against black people. It happens every day. It's been happening for centuries, and it's been invisible to far too many people in our society. That movement made it visible so that we could consider it and address it. And also it's a big problem. But that movement created an appetite for the impossible to actually change this entrenched problem. So, we need social movements to do that and to shift the conversation radically. So, we're talking about police violence in ways that we never did before. We're talking about universal health care in ways that we never did before. We're talking about immigration in ways that we never did before. We're talking about the economy and radically changing the structure of the economy because of social movements, Occupy, the Women's March, the Immigrant Rights Movement. Right, so when we align movements with the electoral power to govern, that is a combination that could take us to where we need to go, right? The movements shift the conversation, and then the ability to elect people, that's how we're able to secure the gains, right? It's a two-step and both of those things are essential. I think for far too long, social movements have been siloed in one particular place, and the ability to elect folks have been siloed in another place and largely governed by corporate interests. And so what we need to do is attach social movements with electoral movements, and that's the work that I'm doing with the Working Families Party. Wow, that's a really great question. I would, if I could give advice to my teenage self, okay, if I could give advice to my teenage self, I would say… The most transformative thing that you could focus on ultimately and the thing that has always really changed the world is a focus on love and solidarity, right? And it sounds hokey, right, but love and solidarity is what fights cynicism. Cynicism is an elaborate project of the right. The far right needs us to be cynical. They're relying on everyday people to drop out, and so I would focus on that. And I think as a young person, at times maybe I took myself too seriously. At times I focused on the sense of doing great things or being great, but it's the love that we share between one another. It's the solidarity that we build as movements that ultimately, I think historically, have transformed the world. And I think a focus on that and a good sense of humor and some humility will go pretty far, so I would probably tell my younger self that, and not to wear those pants.

       "      <td>On Monday, three candidates running for the Democratic presidential nomination shared the stage with formerly incarcerated community leaders at Eastern State Penitentiary Historic Site in Philadelphia, a museum that was once a prison. Sens. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) and Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and philanthropist Tom Steyer were the three candidates to accept the invitation to the Justice Votes 2020 Town Hall, organized by Voters Organized to Educate and the Marshall Project. It was the first time formerly incarcerated people moderated a presidential town hall, an historic opportunity for the candidates to discuss their criminal justice platform with people who’ve been directly impacted. The candidates’ presence signaled the drastic shift that has taken place in the national conversation around criminal justice, in which Democrats support major reforms including marijuana legalization, and the abolition of the death penalty and solitary confinement. One of the moderators, VOTE Executive Director Norris Henderson, who was wrongfully incarcerated for 27 years in Louisiana State Penitentiary, said this election represents a “light that came on.” “People started realizing now that the false rhetoric and all these different laws created the situation we find ourselves in,” Henderson said. “We can’t ‘tough on crime’ our way out of this situation. Mass incarceration impacts people, families, and communities. Millions in our country have been affected by the broken criminal legal system. When we talk about how to fix the system, we should listen to people whoÃ¢ÂÂve been directly affected by it. #JusticeVotes2020 So when Harris came on stage, moderator Vivian Nixon, executive director of College &amp; Community Fellowship, asked her to wrestle with the ways in which her background as a prosecutor has been scrutinized and criticized as too “tough on crime.” “I knew I wanted to be in a role where I could implement change in the criminal justice system,” Harris said. “I was elected DA back in 2003, dark ages compared to where we are now in terms of what the country understands we need by way of reform.” Harris pointed to her Back on Track reentry program, which started in 2005, as a pretrial initiative that allowed first-time drug offenders to get a high school diploma and a job instead of being incarcerated. “When I created that initiative people would say to me, ‘why are you giving them jobs? There are people who have not committed any offense who need jobs,’” Harris said. “‘You’re supposed to be a prosecutor which means you’re supposed to be locking people up, not letting them out.’” Still, much of the criticism surrounding Harris has come from her more recent record, which includes criminalizing truancy as California attorney general, an initiative which targeted parents, especially from low-income and Black and Latinx families. She recently said she regrets those consequences. Last year, she reversed her stance on legalizing recreational marijuana, which she had previously opposed. “The war on drugs? That was a war on our people,” Harris said at the town hall. Booker, who introduced a bill in 2017 to legalize recreational marijuana at the federal level, was asked by Forward Justice Co-Director Daryl Atkinson how the current push to build the recreational marijuana industry—the so-called “green rush”—can include the Black and brown communities who have historically been incarcerated because of marijuana. “Do not come and talk about legalization of marijuana if you are not talking in the same sentence about expunging people’s records,” Booker said. Booker was questioned on his own record and his oversight of the Newark Police Department during his time as mayor. During that time, he pursued an aggressive police strategy and resisted a federal probe into police brutality and misconduct. “When I was elected mayor of the city of Newark, I inherited a police department with decades-long pattern of abuses,” Booker said. “We thought we were doing a good job but we were not.” In a July presidential primary debate, former Vice President Joe Biden criticized Booker’s record. Biden did not attend the town hall, but his legacy of developing tough on crime policies in the 1990s has been an ongoing point of scrutiny leading up to the primary. “The Democratic Party’s hands are not clean on the issue of criminal justice,” said Booker. Philanthropist Tom Steyer, whose criminal justice reform platform includes creating job opportunities for reentering citizens, emphasized the existing racial disparities with incarceration and the “ban the box” movement. “The first thing we need to do is end the discrimination,” Steyer said. “Then, the second question is what can we do to make sure that in face we give those people a chance, you know, a real chance at rehabilitation and a new start.” The billionaire's record of running a hedge fund that invested in private prisons has been criticized, though he now proposes eliminating private prisons. The town hall brought together community leaders who’ve been personally impacted by incarceration and who are now at the forefront of reforming the systems that have led to mass incarceration in the United States. “People closer to the problem are that much closer to the solution,” Henderson said. “It’s only fair that people start recognizing who will be affected by their policies one way or another.”</td>\n",

Plenty strong, according to a detailed analysis conducted by Andrew Fieldhouse for the Economic Policy Institute. After the jump we'll focus on the record of President Obama. Regarding Fieldhouse's conclusion and Barack Obama, first there is the stimulus package passed in 2009. Although its measures were temporary, there were a number of important ones—most notably those relating to the earned income tax credit—that did shift the tax burden in a more progressive direction. There were also the temporary increases in government spending that shifted money predominantly to those below the median income level (increased food stamp benefits, extended unemployment benefits, etc). But still, inequality has worsened during the president's first term, despite these measures. What about going forward? Also, two big sets of changes are hitting the federal tax code. Neither of them are surprises to anyone who follows politics, but I want to discuss them together, to assess their combined impact. On January 1, 2013, the federal marginal rate went up from 35 to 39.6% on income over $400,000 for individuals and $450,000 for married couples (indexed for inflation going forward). Additionally, people earning above those levels will see the tax they pay on capital gains and qualified dividends rise from 15% to 20%. No one else's tax rates went up. To be technical about it, President Obama signed into law an income tax cut for everyone below those levels. That's one major shift toward greater progressivity in the tax code. The other, more easily ignored shift results from Obamacare. Also as of this year, there is a 0.9 percent increase in Medicare taxes on income above $250,000 for married people filing jointly, $125,000 for married people filing separately, and $200,000 for everyone else. Additionally, people earning above those levels will pay a new Medicare tax of 3.8 percent on certain kinds of investment income. And where does this money go? It goes right out to people earning less than four times the poverty rate (about $46,000 for individuals and $94,000 for a family of four) as subsidies to help them pay for health insurance premiums. Additionally, Obamacare funds the expansion of Medicaid (most recently pushed through in Ohio) to millions of Americans who did not previously qualify. In other words the law directly attacks economic inequality, in addition to providing health insurance and, it appears thus far, reducing overall health care costs in America. These two major changes to the tax code have not kicked in yet. But once they do, they should have a significant impact on economic inequality. On their own, are they enough to reduce three and a half decades of damage caused by Reaganite thinking on taxes as well as globalization and the other factors driving that inequality? Of course not. But they will have a real and positive effect. Why am I writing about this now? Part of it relates to the rollout of Obamacare, and my thinking about its long-term impact. Was it the kind of health care reform I wanted? No. But it will help people, of that I have no doubt. Also, I was inspired to take on this topic after seeing the announcement of this coming Sunday's reader forum in the NYT. The forum asks for responses to an initial letter from someone who voted for Obama twice, but who is disappointed in what he's been able to achieve compared to other Democratic presidents such as FDR and LBJ. I take such concerns seriously, and by no means do I argue that Barack Obama has been a perfect president. As a historian, I recognize that comparisons across eras are tricky, to say the least. The New Deal and the Great Society, as well as LBJ's Civil Rights and Voting Rights laws, were tremendously important accomplishments. Without going into too much historical detail, I'll just say that I would have loved to see what Barack Obama could have done with a three-fourths Democratic majority in both houses of Congress like the one FDR had in his first two terms, or even the two thirds majority LBJ had after 1964. Also bear in mind the difference between today's Republicans—people who can't even stand to look at the president, and the Republicans of the past. Three-quarters of congressional Republicans voted for Social Security, and half of Congressional Republicans voted for Medicare (which Ronald Reagan claimed at the time would be the end of freedom for Pete's sake!). Barack Obama's 60 Senate Democrats in 2009-10 included one (Joe Lieberman) who threatened to filibuster, thus killing, health care reform if it included a public option. I'm not here to tear down the accomplishments of past liberal presidents. I'm also not here to say that Barack Obama is above criticism. We should criticize him, from his left, when he needs to act more vigorously in support of progressive goals. But we also need to recognize what he has accomplished as president. We have to be able to do both, because it does the progressive cause no good to engage either in blind hero worship or reflexive dismissal of real achievements. I chose to discuss income and wealth inequality because the fight against it stands at the center of the progressive movement. There is no other single issue that unites our cause quite so powerfully. The policies enacted by President Obama were not enough to stop economic inequality from worsening during his first term, although I don't even want to think about how much worse it would have gotten during the Great Recession without those policies. They did have a positive impact. But in the long run, the tax policies contained in the fiscal cliff deal and Obamacare discussed above should have even a greater effect on fighting economic inequality and thus strengthening our economy across the board. We cannot allow disillusionment over what we did not achieve to dull the energy we need to keep fighting. The extremists we are fighting against are simply too dangerous. And the people we are fighting for cannot afford us that indulgence.  \n",
       "           97      The virulent meme spread across our nation with increasing frequency by Republicans and their racist adherents is that \"anti-racism\" is a code for \"anti-white.\" This is part of a larger pattern of stigmatization of any groups or efforts made to address and redress the racial inequities we still face, and there are myriad variations on the theme, including \"reverse racism,\" \"reverse discrimination\" and \"playing the race card\" or simply a dismissal of anyone who attempts to combat racism by labeling them a racist. Far too frequently we see headlines blasting racist blatherings by Republican politicians and party officials, local, state and national, and their faithful followers repeat these falsities ad nauseam on internet forums, in LTE's, newspaper comments and in personal conversations among family, friends and co-workers. Just use your favorite search engine. It takes but a minute to turn up examples, which are distributed geographically: Texas Republican Official Peter Morrison Talks Secession, Reverse Racism (Jasper, Texas), GOP Rep. Goes on a Racial Rant (Montana), Racist Rant Gets GOP Chairman in Hot Water (Illinois). This claptrap has now made its way onto a billboard in Harrison, Arkansas. Since Daily Kos is a reality-based community, with a readership that has an interest in history, I thought it might be useful to discuss some of the facts with which you might wish to arm yourselves when confronted by this seemingly endless font of bigotry. This is in hopes that in some small way, when faced with any of these memes in the course of daily interactions, online or in real-life mode, you can at least put paid to a few of the most egregious lies and distortions. No guarantee that pushback will change the minds of die-hard bigots, but we never know when facts may fall onto fertile ground, so we need to keep pushing them. Follow me below the fold for more. The organization that takes the hardest hit from those who clearly want to distort its message and purpose is the venerable NAACP, the oldest of the nation's civil rights organizations. Headlines like, \"House freshman calls NAACP chief 'racist' in email\", \"Extremist Hate Group NAACP wants Robert E. Lee’s picture taken down in Florida\" (I'm not linking to the hate site that houses this gem) abound, and whoever the current head of both the national (currently Benjamin  Jealous, whose dad is white) or local NAACP groups is at the time, they are the target of warped Teapublican poutrages. Other newer organizations, like the Southern Poverty Law Center, garner their fair share of sewage from both racists and anti-semites alike, since they were founded by Morris Dees (who is not Jewish but is attacked as if he is), and Joseph J. Levin, Jr. I'm a card-carrying member of the NAACP and have always been fascinated by its history. The Race Riot of 1908 in Abraham Lincoln's hometown of Springfield, Illinois had highlighted the urgent need for an effective civil rights organization in the U.S. This event is often cited as the catalyst for the formation of the NAACP. Mary White Ovington, journalist William English Walling and Henry Moskowitz met in New York City in January 1909 and the NAACP was born. Solicitations for support went out to more than 60 prominent Americans, and a meeting date was set for February 12, 1909. This was intended to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the birth of President Abraham Lincoln, who emancipated enslaved African Americans. While the meeting did not take place until three months later, this date is often cited as the founding date of the organization. The NAACP was founded on February 12, 1909 by a diverse group composed of W. E. B. Du Bois, Ida B. Wells, Archibald Grimké, Henry Moskowitz, Mary White Ovington, Oswald Garrison Villard, William English Walling (the last son of a former slave-holding family),Florence Kelley, a social reformer and friend of Du Bois, and Charles Edward Russell, a renowned muckraker and close friend of Walling who helped plan the NAACP and served as acting chairman of the National Negro Committee (1909), a forerunner to the NAACP. On May 30, 1909, the Niagara Movement conference took place at New York City's Henry Street Settlement House, from which an organization of more than 40 individuals emerged, calling itself the National Negro Committee. Du Bois played a key role in organizing the event and presided over the proceedings. Also in attendance was African-American journalist and anti-lynching crusader Ida B. Wells-Barnett. At its second conference on May 30, 1910, members chose as the organization's name the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and elected its first officers, who were: ...On September 3, 1908 she read an article written by Republican William English Walling, also a Liberal, entitled \"Race War in the North\" in The Independent. Walling described a massive race riot directed at black residents in the hometown of Abraham Lincoln, Springfield, Illinois that led to seven deaths, the destruction of 40 homes and 24 businesses, and 107 indictments against rioters. Walling ended the article by calling for a powerful body of citizens to come to the aid of blacks. Ovington responded to the article by writing Walling and meeting at his apartment in New York City along with social worker Dr. Henry Moskowitz. The group decided to launch a campaign by issuing a call for a national conference on the civil and political rights of African-Americans on the centennial of Lincoln’s birthday, February 12, 1909... After the war, Ovington served the NAACP as board member, executive secretary and chairman. The NAACP fought a long legal battle against segregation and racial discrimination in housing, education, employment, voting and transportation. They appealed to the Supreme Court to rule that several laws passed by southern states were unconstitutional and won three important judgments between 1915-1923 concerning voting rights and housing...Ovington retired as a board member of the NAACP in 1947, ending 38 years of service with the organization. She died on July 15, 1951. In 1906, following a trip to Russia to report on the abortive Russian Revolution of 1905 he married Anna Strunsky, a Jewish immigrant and an aspiring novelist from San Francisco. In 1908 he published Russia's Message, a book inspired by the social unrest he and his wife had observed in Russia. In 1908 Walling and his wife went to Springfield, Illinois to investigate a race riot. As a result of their investigations, Walling wrote an article The Race War in the North for the September 3 issue of The Independent, in which he stated, “the spirit of the abolitionists, of Lincoln and Lovejoy, must be revived and we must come to treat the negro on a plane of absolute political and capitalist equality.” He also appealed for a “large and powerful body of citizens to come to their aid.” The article directly led to the founding of the NAACP. I always find it odd that no one on the right has ever accused me of being \"anti-black\" because of my membership to a whole range of mainly \"white\" organizations over the years, from the ACLU to the AARP. In fact, no one ever calls them \"white\" groups at all, they are just \"groups,\" because white is the norm that needs no descriptor in our society, one must add an adjective to describe anything else. I've voted for white presidents and white senators, attended mostly white colleges and universities, with the exception of Howard University in Washington, D.C. Howard, due to its history and founding purpose, is \"a historically black college\" (HBCU), which of course obfuscates the fact it has over the years graduated white students, especially from the medical school during a time when Ivy League med schools had a Jewish quota. Howard was founded by a white man—Oliver O. Howard, for whom it is named. I remember having a conversation with Harris Wofford during the time he was the president of SUNY Old Westbury, before he became a senator from Pennsylvania. He mentioned having attended Howard Law school. The history of the civil rights movement in this country is one that has been forged out of the activism of people of all backgrounds. I'm always surprised when people question me about my former membership in the Black Panther Party, assuming it was anti-white, simply because of it having \"black\" in the name, and its militancy. Yet anyone familiar with the history of the Rainbow Coalition forged by Fred Hampton knows that to be a lie as well. So next time you encounter someone, online or in real life, spreading faux propaganda about the NAACP or any anti-racist group, hit them with the facts. Better still, if you are white, why not join me in becoming a card-carrying NAACP member. Then you can show them your \"card\" for real.  \n",
       "           98                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Why are the plutocrats, with their great wealth and a political system more likely to listen to them anyway, losing some control to the populists? The answer lies in the particular nature of plutocratic political power in the 21st century and its limitations in a wired mass democracy. You did remember to fall back, right? That means you set your clocks one hour... uh, one hour... Anyway, come on in and see what the rest of punditry has to say. Dana Milbank shows that, if nothing else, the Tea Party is a great force for chaos. That was the day the commonwealth’s Republican Party took what had been a sure thing and instead allowed the tea party to give the Democrats an opening. Supporters of Cuccinelli, the state attorney general, had scrapped the GOP gubernatorial primary, which probably would have resulted in the nomination of Lt. Gov. Bill Bolling, a mainstream conservative who likely would have cruised to victory. But Cuccinelli’s supporters forced the party to cut the electorate out of the process, replacing the primary with a convention. There, a smaller number of tea party activists handed the nomination to Cuccinelli, a man so conservative he had supported legislation that would have allowed the banning of the pill and other forms of birth control. Kathleen Parker has some advice to her own party going into the next cycle of elections. Dear Ms. Know-It-All: It appears the witch Hillary Rodham Clinton is going to run for president. It makes my skin crawl to think of her and that husband of hers back in our White House, not to mention that they are Marxists like Obama and want to turn us into Sweden, for God’s sake. It’s not too soon for Republicans to marshal our forces for a little shock and awe when the Hildebeast finally announces. How can we stop her? Signed, A proud, God-fearing, right-wing wacko bird. Thank you for what seems to be your sincere interest in participating in our country’s health and welfare. And thanks, too, for contacting me, because you need to hear what I have to say. You might want to sit down for this. If you’re on anti-anxiety medication, all the better. ... To the larger point, you must stop witchifying this woman. She has one of the best résumés in the country, certainly compared to anyone who might challenge her. This doesn’t speak to her personality, which seems to aggravate a certain kind of male, or to her involvement with issues that have inspired legitimate criticism. But in hurling personal insults, you are hurting only yourself. The bully always looks worse than the bullied. In so doing, you not only seem juvenile but also look petty and bereft of substantive arguments. While you consider this assessment, imagine how much Hillary must welcome such school-yard taunts. P.S. I'm trying not to feel rather happy about the fact that I did not even know there was a \"Ms. Know-It-All.\"  Not enough Georgetown cocktail parties, I suppose. Ross Douthat compares casino gambling and marijuana legalization to the recent improvements in gay rights because, you know, sin. In 1990, casino gambling was still concentrated in Nevada and Atlantic City. ... Today 23 states have commercial casinos, and the old model of casino-going as a what-happens-in-Vegas excursion has given way to casino-going as routine entertainment. ... The marijuana revolution is arguably not so far advanced, since only two states, Washington and Colorado, are experimenting with outright legalization. ... public opinion on the issue has shifted about as fast as it has on gay marriage — from 32 percent support for legalization in 2002 to 58 percent in the latest Gallup poll. There are significant differences in the ways gambling and pot have won America. The spread of casinos has been more of a top-down phenomenon, driven by states seeking revenue and an industry that’s free with campaign contributions. The permissive turn on marijuana has been a more (if you will) grass-roots affair — driven by activists and artists, influenced by empathy for the terminally ill, and hastened by public exhaustion with the drug war. Nicholas Kristof tries to point out that behind the health care fight is... health care. No, far more serious is the kind of catastrophe facing people like Richard Streeter, 47, a truck driver and recreational vehicle repairman in Eugene, Ore. His problem isn’t Obamacare, but a tumor in his colon that may kill him because Obamacare didn’t come quite soon enough. Streeter had health insurance for decades, but beginning in 2008 his employer no longer offered it as an option.  ... Because he didn’t have health insurance, he put off going to the doctor.  ...  By September, Streeter couldn’t stand the pain any longer ... Streeter made the 100-mile drive to Dr. Gibson’s office in McMinnville, Ore. — and received devastating news. Dr. Gibson had found advanced colon cancer. “It was heartbreaking to see the pain on his face,” Dr. Gibson told me. “It got me very angry with people who insist that Obamacare is a train wreck, when the real train wreck is what people are experiencing every day because they can’t afford care.” Dr. Gibson says that Streeter is the second patient he has had this year who put off getting medical attention because of lack of health insurance and now has advanced colon cancer. So, to those Republicans protesting Obamacare: You’re right that there are appalling problems with the website, but they will be fixed. Likewise, you’re right that President Obama misled voters when he said that everyone could keep their insurance plan because that’s now manifestly not true (although they will be able to get new and better plans, sometimes for less money). But how about showing empathy also for a far larger and more desperate group: The nearly 50 million Americans without insurance who play health care Russian roulette as a result. FamiliesUSA, a health care advocacy group that supports Obamacare, estimated last year that an American dies every 20 minutes for lack of insurance. But insurers are not allowed to abandon enrollees. They must offer consumers options that do comply with the law, and they are scrambling to retain as many of their customers as possible with new policies that are almost certain to be more comprehensive than their old ones. Indeed, in all the furor, people forget how terrible many of the soon-to-be-abandoned policies were. Some had deductibles as high as $10,000 or $25,000 and required large co-pays after that, and some didn’t cover hospital care. Francis Clines reminds us that an awful anniversary is approaching. This is plainly so. The town was roiled anew by a newspaper article last month based on interviews with anonymous law enforcement workers offering fresh and painful details on the six-minute, 154-round onslaught from a troubled 20-year-old who murdered six adults as well with an assault rifle. A promised official state report on the shootings, which residents find puzzlingly overdue, will rake the emotional trauma again when it eventually comes out. ... The town is discovering what all scenes of American mass gun tragedy ultimately learn: the suffering lingers long and even compounds within communities yearning for recovery. The local Newtown Bee newspaper put it this way: “On some days it seems like the great tragedy Newtown suffered on 12/14 has created its own ever-expanding universe, surging out from a big bang amplified by cameras and microphones to places unknown.” Sorry, doc. Fred Pearce details how, despite climate change denier claims that increases in temperature can be blamed on the sun, we're actually in for a solar chill. Lockwood and his colleagues are reassessing the chances of this decline continuing over decades to become the first \"grand solar minimum\" for four centuries. During a grand minimum the normal 11-year solar cycle is suppressed and the sun has virtually no sunspots for several decades. This summer should have seen a peak in the number of sunspots, but it didn't happen. Lockwood thinks there is now a 25 per cent chance of a repetition of the last grand minimum, the late 17th century Maunder Minimum, when there were no sunspots for 70 years. ... The Maunder Minimum coincided with the worst European winters of the little ice age, a period lasting centuries when several regions around the globe experienced unusual cooling. Tree ring studies suggest it cooled the northern hemisphere by up to 0.4 °C. It is more likely that it will simply reduce the warming a little, and set us up for greater warming if it receded.  \n",

                                               Unfortunately for Barack Obama, a growing number of Americans believe that he's doing a poor job as president. Some people think he's too iron-fisted, while others feel he's too passive; and a vocal minority just wants to send him back to Kenya. Meanwhile, charting confirms that the GOP isn't in Kansas anymore; they've pretty much fallen off the map altogether. And their little tea bag, too. The only thing the vast majority of Americans seem to agree on is that the Republican party is the absolute worst. I mean, say what you want about the tenets of National Socialism... at least it's an ethos. Face the Nation: Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA); Rep. Mike Rogers (R-MI); Former CIA/NSA Director Gen.

On Comedy Central... Jon Stewart took issue with the media using him to attack Obamacare. And Stephen Colbert approvingly cited Sen. Rand Paul. Elsewhere... Nevada state Rep. Jim Wheeler (R) explained what representative democracy is all about. \"If that's what they wanted, I'd have to hold my nose, I'd have to bite my tongue and they'd probably have to hold a gun to my head, but yeah, if that's what the citizens of the, if that's what the constituency wants that elected me, that's what they elected me for,\" he said. \"That's what a republic is about. You elected a person for your district to do your wants and wishes, not the wants and wishes of a special interest, not his own wants and wishes, yours.\" Wheeler said today that he believes \"liberal\" operatives are trying to frame him as a bigot by spreading video of the statement on the Internet. Meanwhile... Retired Army Lt. Gen. William Boykin spoke some truth to power. \"Our Constitution puts a civilian in charge of the military and as a result a coup would not be constitutional. You're not going to see a coup in the military.\" And, in Texas... Rumors of the Alamo's demise were greatly exaggerated. \"Horse hockey,\" Patterson, a Republican candidate for lieutenant governor, said Wednesday in a statement. Rumors have circulated in recent weeks, via email and social media, that the U.N. would manage the Alamo if it — and San Antonio's four other Spanish colonial missions — are granted World Heritage status. The story began to swirl in September with an emailed piece titled \"The New Battle of the Alamo\" by George Rodriguez, former president of the San Antonio Tea Party.  \n",

Gore has been everywhere lately. Just last week he presided over his \"24 Hours of Reality\" project which was seen by millions globally! And without even taking a nap the very next day he gave a talk at Making Progress, where he was fired up, more so than many had ever seen him. “They will not be sold and burned. They cannot be sold and burned.” Gore went on to describe how humans are putting 90 million tons of CO2 into the atmosphere every day, “as if it is an open sewer.” That pollution traps the same amount of heat as the energy from “400,000 Hiroshima atomic bombs going off every 24 hours.”  \n",

Wisconsin Sean Duffy, newly hired as a “conservative pundit” on CNN, came by to try and throw doubt on U.S. Army Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman’s testimony on Trump’s Ukrainian dealings. His pathetic attempt at throwing doubt on Vindman’s loyalty to the United States was not well received by CNN host John Berman, but Duffy was only doing what the Republican complicity machine had concocted. Calling out the fact Vindman was born in the Ukraine (his family immigrated to the U.S. when he was three-years-old), did not go down well with much of anyone as Sean Duffy has about as much integrity as an old cobweb. Realizing that he needed to do something resembling damage control, Duffy went to his Twitter account to post this: Lt. Col. Vindman is an American war hero.  As I said clearly this morning on air Ã¢ÂÂI salute Mr. VindmanÃ¢ÂÂs service.Ã¢ÂÂ  My point is that Mr. Vindman is an unelected advisor, he gives ADVICE.  President Trump sets the policy. An interesting note here is that the fact that Mr. Vindman is a adviser who gives “ADVICE” is not a “point,” when you lead by questioning his loyalty. Anyway, Duffy’s tweet was very quickly ratioed* into the netherworld. Don't mind me I'm here for the ratio and comments. pic.twitter.com/rC0PtO4ebz Great American actor Jeffrey Wright dropped in to tell Duffy how he felt. Lev Parnas is an unelected advisor, too - to Trump. His mug shot's on the right. Better get your loyalties straight. pic.twitter.com/DCJxJH5hjJ And then there were the thoughts most of us had. You are such a scumbag. We all saw the clip.I've also reviewed your own military service.You have none. @CNN needs to fire you, yesterday. #FireSeanDuffy Fellow Wisconsin Representative Gwen Moore had some thoughts on Sean Duffy. Lt. Col. Vindman is a Purple Heart vet who is continuing his service by testifying about Trump's efforts to undermine the sanctity of U.S. elections.Meanwhile, Sean Duffy defends Trump, a fellow reality star, who used his official position as POTUS to seek personal gain. https://t.co/bdQCpEOniO And a little walk down memory lane for Dirtbag Duffy. Now do Lt. Gen Flynnhttps://t.co/4Lh6gHA95q And then, some of my favorite memes. pic.twitter.com/M5Gk40geo5 pic.twitter.com/g9V0WOxOnZ And here’s to using reality television for good. pic.twitter.com/Y9hcubGPGE But let’s remember one thing. Dirtbag Duffy deserves this. You're not good at this. But still, CNN did hire him. You're point was that he's not as American as those born here. You are terrible. And the comments on his backpedaling were pretty sweet. Walking back your words like.... pic.twitter.com/DAN7W0kL20 pic.twitter.com/Z1Jx9PVeid Walking back that shit like: pic.twitter.com/aveBUYkqAc And most importantly, the question. Okay. So riddle me this then.One is a Ukraine born American who shows his decorated war pins and medals. The other is a Hungarian born American who shows off his Nazi pin.They're both advisors to Trump. But which one isn't being vilified? It damn sure isn't the Nazi dude Ã°ÂÂ¤Â¨ pic.twitter.com/TtoRl1I0LI *Getting “ratioed” is when there are considerably more responses to one’s tweet than retweets, usually signifying your tweet did not go over well. At all.  \n",

  On Monday, the California Public Utilities Commission announced it would begin an investigation into how privately owned power companies such as Pacific Gas and Electric have used Public Safety Power Shutoffs (PSPSs) this year. The question under investigation is whether companies such as PG&E are adhering to the laws in place when using widespread blackouts as a measure to prevent wildfires. CNN reported, \"The state cannot continue to experience PSPS events on the scope and scale Californians have experienced this month, nor should Californians be subject to the poor execution that PG&E in particular has exhibited,\" said commission President Marybel Batjer. \"The CPUC will demand that utilities prepare for and execute PSPS events in a way that greatly reduces impacts on Californians.\"  \n",

of one percent of the Chicago Public Schools budget is between what they would accept to end their strike and the city’s current offer. That’s $38 million as the strike closes schools for a ninth day. Not only that, the teachers point to nearly $100 million of costs that have been moved from the city budget to the schools budget. “The payment for police in our schools, $33 million, which has traditionally been paid for by the city, was shifted to the schools; a pension payment that has traditionally been paid for by the city has been shifted to the schools,” Chicago Teachers Union Vice President Stacy Davis-Gates told Chicago Tonight. “So you have nearly $100 million of cost-shift from the city to the school budget at a time when we need it, at a time when the city is now, clearly, balancing their budget on the backs of our students.” Another key issue is 30 minutes a day of prep time that elementary school teachers lost under former Mayor Rahm Emanuel. According to CTU, “Teachers used that time to contact parents, grade papers, prepare lesson plans and update curricula, reducing the amount of unpaid labor they put in outside of the work day. While CPS counts that half hour as ‘instructional minutes,’ for many teachers that time is spent wiping up spilled milk and cleaning up after students as they eat their breakfasts in the classrooms.” SEIU Local 73, which represents many school support staff from custodians to classroom assistants, has reached a tentative deal to end its strike, which started alongside the teachers strike. Meanwhile, over in Massachusetts, teachers in Dedham won an agreement and unanimously ratified it after just one weekday of strike. It was the first teachers strike in 12 years in the state, where public workers are legally prohibited from striking.  \n",

Ever wonder, for example, if a local march, rally, or movement can really change the way insider politics function? Can organizing really impact our laws and governance? Maurice Mitchell, the national director of the Working Families Party and a key leader in the Movement for Black Lives (the global network behind Black Lives Matter), broke down exactly why—and how—social movements can and do lead to tremendous change in politics. “What social movements do when they're at their best,” Mitchell explained to Daily Kos in an interview behind the scenes at Netroots Nation, the country’s largest conference for progressives, “is that they render the invisible visible, and they render the impossible possible.” One big example in the United States? The Black Lives Matter movement and the exposure it’s brought to police violence and, in particular, the violence against black men and black transgender women. It’s no surprise, then, that police violence is the issue that “transformed” Mitchell the most as an organizer. “One of our classmates was killed by an undercover police officer, and it mobilized and politicized many of my fellow classmates, and it certainly politicized me,” Mitchell recalled in reference to his college days. Since then, he said, “I've been committing all of my energy, all of my time, all of my passion to making sure that young people just like him won't also share his fate; that other black, brown and poor men and women could actually thrive in this country.” “It's a lot deeper than shoving somebody into a poll and getting them to pull a lever for a particular candidate,” Mitchell stressed. “It's about acquainting somebody with their innate power and acquainting them with the amazing transformational ability of collective power to change the world.” Feeling motivated yet? Check out Mitchell’s full interview below, where he talks to Daily Kos about how to mobilize potential voters, how the far right uses cynicism to their advantage, and how to inspire people to reach their own power. I've been organizing since I was a young person, but I think the issue that really transformed me the most was police violence. When I was still a very young person in college, one of our classmates was killed by an undercover police officer, and it mobilized and politicized many of my fellow classmates, and it certainly politicized me, and I began to organize direct actions. We held a huge, more than a thousand person direct action. We were in D.C., and we went to the Department of Justice, and after that particular organizing moment, I never looked back. And I've been committing all of my energy, all of my time, all of my passion to making sure that young people just like him won't also share his fate; that other black, brown and poor men and women could actually thrive in this country. We meet voters where they are by respecting with them, by being in conversation and relationship with them. I'm an organizer, so fundamentally I always look through the prism of relationships, right, and I think what has happened over time with our electoral politics is that it's become very corporate, very metrics-based, very sort of consultant-driven, right, and we've lost the heart and soul of our politics. Politics are ultimately about people, and politics is about some of the most intimate things in our lives … how our children are educated, whether or not I have meaningful health care, whether or not I live in a community where I can breathe fresh air. That's what politics are ultimately about. And so rooting it in those intimate conversations and relationships, and then presenting a vision that meets the scale of the problems that everyday working people are feeling. There's a reason why people have dropped out of our politics, because it doesn't align with their values, and it doesn't resonate with them. And also the conversation is happening in the air, outside of them, and so coming back to the basics of organizing is going to be key to mobilizing all of those folks that have dropped out of our politics but we desperately need not just to vote, but to be organized. And this is why that I as an organizer—like organizing is my religion, but why I put a primacy on organizing because organizing gets the goods every day, right? When you bring people together, and they're able to surface their own power and they're able to connect with one another, they're transformed by that work. And once they're transformed, just like me and my transformational experience as a young person, as a college student, once you're transformed by the work, you're forever transformed, right. So it's a lot deeper than shoving somebody into a poll and getting them to pull a lever for a particular candidate. It's about acquainting somebody with their innate power and acquainting them with the amazing transformational ability of collective power to change the world. I came from movement building and the Movement for Black Lives. And one of the things that I learned from that experience is that the power of social movements could really change the world. And what social movements do when they're at their best is that they render the invisible visible, and they render the impossible possible. So what do I mean by that? So social movements, let's take the Movement for Black Lives, render a reality that has been invisible in our society, the police killing of black folks and state violence against black people. It happens every day. It's been happening for centuries, and it's been invisible to far too many people in our society. That movement made it visible so that we could consider it and address it. And also it's a big problem. But that movement created an appetite for the impossible to actually change this entrenched problem. So, we need social movements to do that and to shift the conversation radically. So, we're talking about police violence in ways that we never did before. We're talking about universal health care in ways that we never did before. We're talking about immigration in ways that we never did before. We're talking about the economy and radically changing the structure of the economy because of social movements, Occupy, the Women's March, the Immigrant Rights Movement. Right, so when we align movements with the electoral power to govern, that is a combination that could take us to where we need to go, right? The movements shift the conversation, and then the ability to elect people, that's how we're able to secure the gains, right? It's a two-step and both of those things are essential. I think for far too long, social movements have been siloed in one particular place, and the ability to elect folks have been siloed in another place and largely governed by corporate interests. And so what we need to do is attach social movements with electoral movements, and that's the work that I'm doing with the Working Families Party. Wow, that's a really great question. I would, if I could give advice to my teenage self, okay, if I could give advice to my teenage self, I would say… The most transformative thing that you could focus on ultimately and the thing that has always really changed the world is a focus on love and solidarity, right? And it sounds hokey, right, but love and solidarity is what fights cynicism. Cynicism is an elaborate project of the right. The far right needs us to be cynical. They're relying on everyday people to drop out, and so I would focus on that. And I think as a young person, at times maybe I took myself too seriously. At times I focused on the sense of doing great things or being great, but it's the love that we share between one another. It's the solidarity that we build as movements that ultimately, I think historically, have transformed the world. And I think a focus on that and a good sense of humor and some humility will go pretty far, so I would probably tell my younger self that, and not to wear those pants.

Sens. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) and Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and philanthropist Tom Steyer were the three candidates to accept the invitation to the Justice Votes 2020 Town Hall, organized by Voters Organized to Educate and the Marshall Project. It was the first time formerly incarcerated people moderated a presidential town hall, an historic opportunity for the candidates to discuss their criminal justice platform with people who’ve been directly impacted. The candidates’ presence signaled the drastic shift that has taken place in the national conversation around criminal justice, in which Democrats support major reforms including marijuana legalization, and the abolition of the death penalty and solitary confinement. One of the moderators, VOTE Executive Director Norris Henderson, who was wrongfully incarcerated for 27 years in Louisiana State Penitentiary, said this election represents a “light that came on.” “People started realizing now that the false rhetoric and all these different laws created the situation we find ourselves in,” Henderson said. “We can’t ‘tough on crime’ our way out of this situation. Mass incarceration impacts people, families, and communities. Millions in our country have been affected by the broken criminal legal system. When we talk about how to fix the system, we should listen to people whoÃ¢ÂÂve been directly affected by it. #JusticeVotes2020 So when Harris came on stage, moderator Vivian Nixon, executive director of College & Community Fellowship, asked her to wrestle with the ways in which her background as a prosecutor has been scrutinized and criticized as too “tough on crime.” “I knew I wanted to be in a role where I could implement change in the criminal justice system,” Harris said. “I was elected DA back in 2003, dark ages compared to where we are now in terms of what the country understands we need by way of reform.” Harris pointed to her Back on Track reentry program, which started in 2005, as a pretrial initiative that allowed first-time drug offenders to get a high school diploma and a job instead of being incarcerated. “When I created that initiative people would say to me, ‘why are you giving them jobs? There are people who have not committed any offense who need jobs,’” Harris said. “‘You’re supposed to be a prosecutor which means you’re supposed to be locking people up, not letting them out.’” Still, much of the criticism surrounding Harris has come from her more recent record, which includes criminalizing truancy as California attorney general, an initiative which targeted parents, especially from low-income and Black and Latinx families. She recently said she regrets those consequences. Last year, she reversed her stance on legalizing recreational marijuana, which she had previously opposed. “The war on drugs? That was a war on our people,” Harris said at the town hall. Booker, who introduced a bill in 2017 to legalize recreational marijuana at the federal level, was asked by Forward Justice Co-Director Daryl Atkinson how the current push to build the recreational marijuana industry—the so-called “green rush”—can include the Black and brown communities who have historically been incarcerated because of marijuana. “Do not come and talk about legalization of marijuana if you are not talking in the same sentence about expunging people’s records,” Booker said. Booker was questioned on his own record and his oversight of the Newark Police Department during his time as mayor. During that time, he pursued an aggressive police strategy and resisted a federal probe into police brutality and misconduct. “When I was elected mayor of the city of Newark, I inherited a police department with decades-long pattern of abuses,” Booker said. “We thought we were doing a good job but we were not.” In a July presidential primary debate, former Vice President Joe Biden criticized Booker’s record. Biden did not attend the town hall, but his legacy of developing tough on crime policies in the 1990s has been an ongoing point of scrutiny leading up to the primary. “The Democratic Party’s hands are not clean on the issue of criminal justice,” said Booker. Philanthropist Tom Steyer, whose criminal justice reform platform includes creating job opportunities for reentering citizens, emphasized the existing racial disparities with incarceration and the “ban the box” movement. “The first thing we need to do is end the discrimination,” Steyer said. “Then, the second question is what can we do to make sure that in face we give those people a chance, you know, a real chance at rehabilitation and a new start.” The billionaire's record of running a hedge fund that invested in private prisons has been criticized, though he now proposes eliminating private prisons. The town hall brought together community leaders who’ve been personally impacted by incarceration and who are now at the forefront of reforming the systems that have led to mass incarceration in the United States. “People closer to the problem are that much closer to the solution,” Henderson said. “It’s only fair that people start recognizing who will be affected by their policies one way or another.”  \n",

It seems like a lifetime ago that I said we were setting up for a big week, but that was actually yesterday. And it turned out that what I thought would be the set-up day was the big day after all. At least, for now. For all we know, today will be bigger than yesterday. And tomorrow, bigger still. But right now, nothing’s bigger than having Greg Dworkin and Joan McCarter join us to marvel at the day/lifetime that was. And I mean, just was. As in just yesterday. And wait until you hear what they have to say about what will be. Well, technically, you’ll have to wait. At least until 9. So, that’s taken care of. One less item on the to-do list, as far as I’m concerned. Good for me! I love efficiency. PODCAST LISTENERS: There’s a new podcast platform in town, and the big news is: this one pays! RadioPublic pays podcast producers at $20 CPM for listens on their native app (available for iPhones & Androids), financed by pre- and post-roll ads they insert. Not a bad way to support the show, with somebody else’s money! So if you’re a podcast listener, please consider downloading the RadioPublic app on your Android or iOS phone. Yes, you can still download directly from their site, or listen to the player embedded here at Daily Kos. But it’s listens in their app that count toward payment. And get this: listen to just three episodes in their app, and we earn a one-time, $1 “loyal listener” bonus. Nothing changes on our end. It’s still Greg Dworkin, Joan McCarter, plus also, me. And you! As always, we still want your voice on the air with us. Sit down with your smart phone or other electronic recording device and send us your stories and commentary to share with the audience. There’s no easier way to try your hand at podcasting, without all the hassle! Of course there’s no substitute for having your support via Patreon, or one-time contributions via Square Cash. (And hey, if you want a cool trick for donating sorta-kinda cost free, get their cash.me app and use this share code to get $5 in your account (plus $5 in mine) when you send your first $5 (to anyone)! Another day, another day closer to… something, but what? David Waldman pulls up the KITM GPS: Lt. Col. Alexander S. Vindman, the top Ukraine expert on the National Security Council and impeachment witness from central casting, reported for duty at Capitol Hill in his dress blues today, causing a run on purple heart band-aids around DC. Trumpers find it suspect that a former Ukrainian would speak Ukrainian. Trump finds it suspect that witnesses witness. Nancy Pelosi likes witnesses, and presently is nailing down those goalposts the Republicans keep running off with. You’d think the White House photographer could put a piece of gaffer tape up on the wall behind himself, so everyone would have the same thing to look at. You’d think Trump could lie better, considering he owes his success and survival only to lying. For the last few years, Trump’s bald-orange-faced, very inept lying has been enabled and supported by both-sideist media, leaving the sole solution available laughing in his face. The media, of course, reacted to the public reclaiming their power by turning their false-equivalency fire hoses onto the public. And here’s a new tip: If the player hiccups or drops the audio between the shows, just go ahead and stop and restart it, and things should go smoothly after that.\n",

floundering. Now, IRS emails obtained by ProPublica help show why: The agency has allowed the tax preparation industry to write the rules. The IRS tried to hide the documents from public view, initially withholding more than 100 pages of emails between agency officials and industry representatives in response to ProPublica’s Freedom of Information Act request filed in April. The agency released the emails this month only after ProPublica sued. This year, as part of our coverage of the IRS and TurboTax maker Intuit, we filed a request for correspondence between the IRS and the Free File Alliance, an industry group. The request sought records surrounding a public-private partnership called Free File. Under that program, which has long been championed by Intuit, the IRS agrees not to create its own tax filing system that would pose a threat to the industry’s profits. In exchange, Intuit and several other tax prep companies agree to offer free tax filing to most Americans. But the program has been declining for years, with less than 3% of eligible Americans using it this year. The email correspondence sheds light on a pivotal moment for the future of Free File in the fall of 2018: An expert body called the IRS Advisory Council (IRSAC) had spent months investigating the program. It was preparing to publish a blistering report concluding that the IRS’ “deficient oversight and performance standards for the Free File program put vulnerable taxpayers at risk.” [...] Ã¢ÂÂTell Natives they canÃ¢ÂÂt be Native for 500 years and no one bats an eye. Tell white people they canÃ¢ÂÂt be Native for Halloween and everyone loses their mind.Ã¢ÂÂ One of the outcomes of a political system in which big money is required to get elected to anything above local office is that elected officials are disproportionately wealthy, and working people end up underrepresented just in the matter of who is in the government, making decisions—never mind our under-representation at high-dollar fundraisers and meetings with lobbyists. So, as the effort to recall Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker gears up, it's interesting to hear that Professional Firefighters of Wisconsin President Mahlon Mitchell is considering a campaign to replace Walker. _Mother Jones'_ Andy Kroll writes that: Now Mitchell is eyeing a bigger stage: the governor's mansion. In an interview with Mother Jones, he said he was \"seriously considering a run\" for governor in a potential recall election targeting Walker. He said he believes Wisconsinites are sick of professional politicians not following through on campaign promises, and that a populist candidate running against Walker stands a better chance of unseating the governor. The ideal candidate would be \"able to talk with common people about common issues,\" Mitchell said. \"Tell 'em what you can do and what you can't do.\" On today’s Kagro in the Morning show: Testimony today from an Army Lt.

On May 11, 2011, President Barack Obama appeared in a rare late night broadcast to announce the United States had conducted a military operation that killed Osama bin Laden. It was one of those moments in life where you remember the details of where you watched it. I recall my husband and I were in a hotel room in Ft. Collins, Colorado, glued to every word of President Obama’s nine-minute statement. There was a sense of national, collective relief. It was one of the defining moments of President Obama’s two terms. Roughly eight and a half years later, Donald Trump stood behind a presidential podium to announce another successful military operation, this time killing Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the United State’s most-wanted terrorist. In stark contrast to Obama’s speech, in which he repeatedly thanked U.S. troops for their “professionalism, patriotism, and unparalleled courage,” Donald Trump delivered his message in lengthy, rambling 46 minutes, in which he released sensitive details of the operation that has military officials cringing and he spent a good deal of time largely congratulating himself, using terms and descriptions that were un-presidential, to say the least. To show just how different the two announcements were, Jimmy Kimmel’s team mashed up a video comparing the two. What Donald Trump said is nothing short of startling, especially in comparison to such a measured, presidential-sounding announcement. We mashed up @BarackObamaÃ¢ÂÂs Bin Laden speech with @RealDonaldTrumpÃ¢ÂÂs al-Baghdadi speech, and the results are amazing pic.twitter.com/Z8yfxSYWLd As military historian Max Boot noted in The Washington Post, “Trump’s news conference should have been his shining hour. Instead, it showed yet again why he is utterly unfit to be commander in chief.” One might even say he “choked like a dog.” The incompetence is even more stark in contrast to President Obama. We must return to decency in 2020.\n",

                           From the beginning, it’s been clear that the “transcript” produced by the White House of Donald Trump’s “prefect call” with Ukrainian President Zelensky was … not a transcript. It’s a “read out,” an approximation recreated from notes. There may be a more accurate transcript somewhere, but if there is, it’s likely locked down tight in a high security server. Or destroyed. But the Tuesday testimony from Lt. Colonel Alexander Vindman provides the first glimpse of just how bad the “not a transcript” really is. And the answer is … bad. The New York Times reports that Vindman testified that when he saw the publicity released document, he sought to amend the text to include a number of “missing words” and “key phrases” that had appeared in the actual conversation between Trump and Zelensky. Those missing words were not minor. For example, left out of the text was Trump insisting “that there were recordings of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. discussing Ukraine corruption.” Also missing from the text that Zelensky made it clear Trump wanted him to announce an investigation of Burisma Holdings, the company where Hunter Biden served on the board Vindman said that he offered up both these corrections when the document was being assembled, but they were not included. While neither of these omissions really changes the meaning of the conversation, which was already clear, but they do prevent an explicit underlining of what Trump was insisting on in exchange for American assistance.\n",

                                                    In a surprise announcement on Tuesday, the NCAA announced that it is making a drastic change to an archaic, exploitative system regarding student-athletes: It is lifting a ban on athletes profiting from their own names and likenesses. It’s been a long, long time coming, but the NCAA is finally doing the right thing. From the Associated Press: The NCAA Board of Governors has taken the first step toward allowing athletes to cash in on their fame. The board voted unanimously on Tuesday to clear the way for the amateur athletes to “benefit from the use of their name, image and likeness.” The vote came during a meeting at Emory University in Atlanta. In a news release, board chair Michael V. Drake said the board realized that it “must embrace change to provide the best possible experience for college athletes.” “Must embrace” is exactly right. The NCAA has been facing increasing pressure after losing a major lawsuit in 2014. The lawsuit was filed by former UCLA men’s basketball player Ed O’Bannon and 19 other former student-athletes, who challenged the legality of the NCAA’s prohibition. More recently, on Sept. 30, California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed the Fair Pay to Play Act, allowing student-athletes to get paid for endorsement deals. Other states were on the verge of passing similar legislation, and the writing was on the wall for the NCAA. Needless to say, this is a big deal for the collegiate sports world. Modern-day college athletes are not part-time players. Fitness and diet regimes are followed year-round now, and there is little to no downtime for top Division 1 players, who also somehow fit in classes. It’s also notable that the current system is actually a systemically racist structure. Far too many student-athletes come from low-income backgrounds, and the NCAA not only held them down financially, but it also held their families and loved ones down as well. Imagine having the physical gift and the drive and determination it takes to become a high-level athlete and having to sit back and see fans walking around in jerseys with your name on the back, while your university makes extreme profits, and yet, you can’t afford to buy dinner, let alone a car. And taking classes constitutes an entire second job. The current NCAA rules are so restrictive that in my time working with student-athletes at a major public university, we had to sit through an annual session about the dos and don’ts of helping student-athletes. I recall one athletic department administrator telling us that even if a student-athlete wanted to send a letter home to their mother, we could not even give them a stamp. That would be an impermissible benefit. These meetings took place just down the hall from the athletic department store, where jerseys were sold with those same player names on the back, the profits from which no doubt paid those administrative salaries. At the end of the day, the NCAA made an estimated revenue in 2017 of $1.1 billion, all of it from the blood, sweat, and tears of student-athletes. It’s about time they got to have a slice of the pie.\n",

came by to try and throw doubt on U.S. Army Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman’s testimony on Trump’s Ukrainian dealings. His pathetic attempt at throwing doubt on Vindman’s loyalty to the United States was not well received by CNN host John Berman, but Duffy was only doing what the Republican complicity machine had concocted. Calling out the fact Vindman was born in the Ukraine (his family immigrated to the U.S. when he was three-years-old), did not go down well with much of anyone as Sean Duffy has about as much integrity as an old cobweb. Realizing that he needed to do something resembling damage control, Duffy went to his Twitter account to post this: Lt. Col. Vindman is an American war hero.  As I said clearly this morning on air Ã¢ÂÂI salute Mr. VindmanÃ¢ÂÂs service.Ã¢ÂÂ  My point is that Mr. Vindman is an unelected advisor, he gives ADVICE.  President Trump sets the policy. An interesting note here is that the fact that Mr. Vindman is a adviser who gives “ADVICE” is not a “point,” when you lead by questioning his loyalty. Anyway, Duffy’s tweet was very quickly ratioed* into the netherworld. Don't mind me I'm here for the ratio and comments. pic.twitter.com/rC0PtO4ebz Great American actor Jeffrey Wright dropped in to tell Duffy how he felt. Lev Parnas is an unelected advisor, too - to Trump. His mug shot's on the right. Better get your loyalties straight. pic.twitter.com/DCJxJH5hjJ And then there were the thoughts most of us had. You are such a scumbag. We all saw the clip.I've also reviewed your own military service.You have none. @CNN needs to fire you, yesterday. #FireSeanDuffy Fellow Wisconsin Representative Gwen Moore had some thoughts on Sean Duffy. Lt. Col. Vindman is a Purple Heart vet who is continuing his service by testifying about Trump's efforts to undermine the sanctity of U.S. elections.Meanwhile, Sean Duffy defends Trump, a fellow reality star, who used his official position as POTUS to seek personal gain. https://t.co/bdQCpEOniO And a little walk down memory lane for Dirtbag Duffy. Now do Lt. Gen Flynnhttps://t.co/4Lh6gHA95q And then, some of my favorite memes. pic.twitter.com/M5Gk40geo5 pic.twitter.com/g9V0WOxOnZ And here’s to using reality television for good. pic.twitter.com/Y9hcubGPGE But let’s remember one thing. Dirtbag Duffy deserves this. You're not good at this. But still, CNN did hire him. You're point was that he's not as American as those born here. You are terrible. And the comments on his backpedaling were pretty sweet. Walking back your words like.... pic.twitter.com/DAN7W0kL20 pic.twitter.com/Z1Jx9PVeid Walking back that shit like: pic.twitter.com/aveBUYkqAc And most importantly, the question. Okay. So riddle me this then.One is a Ukraine born American who shows his decorated war pins and medals. The other is a Hungarian born American who shows off his Nazi pin.They're both advisors to Trump. But which one isn't being vilified? It damn sure isn't the Nazi dude Ã°ÂÂ¤Â¨ pic.twitter.com/TtoRl1I0LI *Getting “ratioed” is when there are considerably more responses to one’s tweet than retweets, usually signifying your tweet did not go over well.

would begin an investigation into how privately owned power companies such as Pacific Gas and Electric have used Public Safety Power Shutoffs (PSPSs) this year. The question under investigation is whether companies such as PG&E are adhering to the laws in place when using widespread blackouts as a measure to prevent wildfires. CNN reported, \"The state cannot continue to experience PSPS events on the scope and scale Californians have experienced this month, nor should Californians be subject to the poor execution that PG&E in particular has exhibited,\" said commission President Marybel Batjer. \"The CPUC will demand that utilities prepare for and execute PSPS events in a way that greatly reduces impacts on Californians.\"\n",



                                                                                             Chicago teachers say that just half of one percent of the Chicago Public Schools budget is between what they would accept to end their strike and the city’s current offer. That’s $38 million as the strike closes schools for a ninth day. Not only that, the teachers point to nearly $100 million of costs that have been moved from the city budget to the schools budget. “The payment for police in our schools, $33 million, which has traditionally been paid for by the city, was shifted to the schools; a pension payment that has traditionally been paid for by the city has been shifted to the schools,” Chicago Teachers Union Vice President Stacy Davis-Gates told Chicago Tonight. “So you have nearly $100 million of cost-shift from the city to the school budget at a time when we need it, at a time when the city is now, clearly, balancing their budget on the backs of our students.” Another key issue is 30 minutes a day of prep time that elementary school teachers lost under former Mayor Rahm Emanuel. According to CTU, “Teachers used that time to contact parents, grade papers, prepare lesson plans and update curricula, reducing the amount of unpaid labor they put in outside of the work day. While CPS counts that half hour as ‘instructional minutes,’ for many teachers that time is spent wiping up spilled milk and cleaning up after students as they eat their breakfasts in the classrooms.” SEIU Local 73, which represents many school support staff from custodians to classroom assistants, has reached a tentative deal to end its strike, which started alongside the teachers strike. Meanwhile, over in Massachusetts, teachers in Dedham won an agreement and unanimously ratified it after just one weekday of strike. It was the first teachers strike in 12 years in the state, where public workers are legally prohibited from striking.\n",
       "            922226    Ever wondered how, precisely, social movements lead to change? Ever wonder, for example, if a local march, rally, or movement can really change the way insider politics function? Can organizing really impact our laws and governance? Maurice Mitchell, the national director of the Working Families Party and a key leader in the Movement for Black Lives (the global network behind Black Lives Matter), broke down exactly why—and how—social movements can and do lead to tremendous change in politics. “What social movements do when they're at their best,” Mitchell explained to Daily Kos in an interview behind the scenes at Netroots Nation, the country’s largest conference for progressives, “is that they render the invisible visible, and they render the impossible possible.” One big example in the United States? The Black Lives Matter movement and the exposure it’s brought to police violence and, in particular, the violence against black men and black transgender women. It’s no surprise, then, that police violence is the issue that “transformed” Mitchell the most as an organizer. “One of our classmates was killed by an undercover police officer, and it mobilized and politicized many of my fellow classmates, and it certainly politicized me,” Mitchell recalled in reference to his college days. Since then, he said, “I've been committing all of my energy, all of my time, all of my passion to making sure that young people just like him won't also share his fate; that other black, brown and poor men and women could actually thrive in this country.” “It's a lot deeper than shoving somebody into a poll and getting them to pull a lever for a particular candidate,” Mitchell stressed. “It's about acquainting somebody with their innate power and acquainting them with the amazing transformational ability of collective power to change the world.” Feeling motivated yet? Check out Mitchell’s full interview below, where he talks to Daily Kos about how to mobilize potential voters, how the far right uses cynicism to their advantage, and how to inspire people to reach their own power. I've been organizing since I was a young person, but I think the issue that really transformed me the most was police violence. When I was still a very young person in college, one of our classmates was killed by an undercover police officer, and it mobilized and politicized many of my fellow classmates, and it certainly politicized me, and I began to organize direct actions. We held a huge, more than a thousand person direct action. We were in D.C., and we went to the Department of Justice, and after that particular organizing moment, I never looked back. And I've been committing all of my energy, all of my time, all of my passion to making sure that young people just like him won't also share his fate; that other black, brown and poor men and women could actually thrive in this country. We meet voters where they are by respecting with them, by being in conversation and relationship with them. I'm an organizer, so fundamentally I always look through the prism of relationships, right, and I think what has happened over time with our electoral politics is that it's become very corporate, very metrics-based, very sort of consultant-driven, right, and we've lost the heart and soul of our politics. Politics are ultimately about people, and politics is about some of the most intimate things in our lives … how our children are educated, whether or not I have meaningful health care, whether or not I live in a community where I can breathe fresh air. That's what politics are ultimately about. And so rooting it in those intimate conversations and relationships, and then presenting a vision that meets the scale of the problems that everyday working people are feeling. There's a reason why people have dropped out of our politics, because it doesn't align with their values, and it doesn't resonate with them. And also the conversation is happening in the air, outside of them, and so coming back to the basics of organizing is going to be key to mobilizing all of those folks that have dropped out of our politics but we desperately need not just to vote, but to be organized. And this is why that I as an organizer—like organizing is my religion, but why I put a primacy on organizing because organizing gets the goods every day, right? When you bring people together, and they're able to surface their own power and they're able to connect with one another, they're transformed by that work. And once they're transformed, just like me and my transformational experience as a young person, as a college student, once you're transformed by the work, you're forever transformed, right. So it's a lot deeper than shoving somebody into a poll and getting them to pull a lever for a particular candidate. It's about acquainting somebody with their innate power and acquainting them with the amazing transformational ability of collective power to change the world. I came from movement building and the Movement for Black Lives. And one of the things that I learned from that experience is that the power of social movements could really change the world. And what social movements do when they're at their best is that they render the invisible visible, and they render the impossible possible. So what do I mean by that? So social movements, let's take the Movement for Black Lives, render a reality that has been invisible in our society, the police killing of black folks and state violence against black people. It happens every day. It's been happening for centuries, and it's been invisible to far too many people in our society. That movement made it visible so that we could consider it and address it. And also it's a big problem. But that movement created an appetite for the impossible to actually change this entrenched problem. So, we need social movements to do that and to shift the conversation radically. So, we're talking about police violence in ways that we never did before. We're talking about universal health care in ways that we never did before. We're talking about immigration in ways that we never did before. We're talking about the economy and radically changing the structure of the economy because of social movements, Occupy, the Women's March, the Immigrant Rights Movement. Right, so when we align movements with the electoral power to govern, that is a combination that could take us to where we need to go, right? The movements shift the conversation, and then the ability to elect people, that's how we're able to secure the gains, right? It's a two-step and both of those things are essential. I think for far too long, social movements have been siloed in one particular place, and the ability to elect folks have been siloed in another place and largely governed by corporate interests. And so what we need to do is attach social movements with electoral movements, and that's the work that I'm doing with the Working Families Party. Wow, that's a really great question. I would, if I could give advice to my teenage self, okay, if I could give advice to my teenage self, I would say… The most transformative thing that you could focus on ultimately and the thing that has always really changed the world is a focus on love and solidarity, right? And it sounds hokey, right, but love and solidarity is what fights cynicism. Cynicism is an elaborate project of the right. The far right needs us to be cynical. They're relying on everyday people to drop out, and so I would focus on that. And I think as a young person, at times maybe I took myself too seriously. At times I focused on the sense of doing great things or being great, but it's the love that we share between one another. It's the solidarity that we build as movements that ultimately, I think historically, have transformed the world. And I think a focus on that and a good sense of humor and some humility will go pretty far, so I would probably tell my younger self that, and not to wear those pants.

Sens. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) and Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and philanthropist Tom Steyer were the three candidates to accept the invitation to the Justice Votes 2020 Town Hall, organized by Voters Organized to Educate and the Marshall Project. It was the first time formerly incarcerated people moderated a presidential town hall, an historic opportunity for the candidates to discuss their criminal justice platform with people who’ve been directly impacted. The candidates’ presence signaled the drastic shift that has taken place in the national conversation around criminal justice, in which Democrats support major reforms including marijuana legalization, and the abolition of the death penalty and solitary confinement. One of the moderators, VOTE Executive Director Norris Henderson, who was wrongfully incarcerated for 27 years in Louisiana State Penitentiary, said this election represents a “light that came on.” “People started realizing now that the false rhetoric and all these different laws created the situation we find ourselves in,” Henderson said. “We can’t ‘tough on crime’ our way out of this situation. Mass incarceration impacts people, families, and communities. Millions in our country have been affected by the broken criminal legal system. When we talk about how to fix the system, we should listen to people whoÃ¢ÂÂve been directly affected by it. #JusticeVotes2020 So when Harris came on stage, moderator Vivian Nixon, executive director of College & Community Fellowship, asked her to wrestle with the ways in which her background as a prosecutor has been scrutinized and criticized as too “tough on crime.” “I knew I wanted to be in a role where I could implement change in the criminal justice system,” Harris said. “I was elected DA back in 2003, dark ages compared to where we are now in terms of what the country understands we need by way of reform.” Harris pointed to her Back on Track reentry program, which started in 2005, as a pretrial initiative that allowed first-time drug offenders to get a high school diploma and a job instead of being incarcerated. “When I created that initiative people would say to me, ‘why are you giving them jobs? There are people who have not committed any offense who need jobs,’” Harris said. “‘You’re supposed to be a prosecutor which means you’re supposed to be locking people up, not letting them out.’” Still, much of the criticism surrounding Harris has come from her more recent record, which includes criminalizing truancy as California attorney general, an initiative which targeted parents, especially from low-income and Black and Latinx families. She recently said she regrets those consequences. Last year, she reversed her stance on legalizing recreational marijuana, which she had previously opposed. “The war on drugs? That was a war on our people,” Harris said at the town hall. Booker, who introduced a bill in 2017 to legalize recreational marijuana at the federal level, was asked by Forward Justice Co-Director Daryl Atkinson how the current push to build the recreational marijuana industry—the so-called “green rush”—can include the Black and brown communities who have historically been incarcerated because of marijuana. “Do not come and talk about legalization of marijuana if you are not talking in the same sentence about expunging people’s records,” Booker said. Booker was questioned on his own record and his oversight of the Newark Police Department during his time as mayor. During that time, he pursued an aggressive police strategy and resisted a federal probe into police brutality and misconduct. “When I was elected mayor of the city of Newark, I inherited a police department with decades-long pattern of abuses,” Booker said. “We thought we were doing a good job but we were not.” In a July presidential primary debate, former Vice President Joe Biden criticized Booker’s record. Biden did not attend the town hall, but his legacy of developing tough on crime policies in the 1990s has been an ongoing point of scrutiny leading up to the primary. “The Democratic Party’s hands are not clean on the issue of criminal justice,” said Booker. Philanthropist Tom Steyer, whose criminal justice reform platform includes creating job opportunities for reentering citizens, emphasized the existing racial disparities with incarceration and the “ban the box” movement. “The first thing we need to do is end the discrimination,” Steyer said. “Then, the second question is what can we do to make sure that in face we give those people a chance, you know, a real chance at rehabilitation and a new start.” The billionaire's record of running a hedge fund that invested in private prisons has been criticized, though he now proposes eliminating private prisons. The town hall brought together community leaders who’ve been personally impacted by incarceration and who are now at the forefront of reforming the systems that have led to mass incarceration in the United States. “People closer to the problem are that much closer to the solution,” Henderson said. “It’s only fair that people start recognizing who will be affected by their policies one way or another.”\n",

Someone, anyway, got access to the Times Editorial Board computers and turned out this parody editorial on Obamacare: Congressional Republicans have stoked consumer fears and confusion with charges that the health care reform law is causing insurers to cancel existing policies and will force many people to pay substantially higher premiums next year for coverage they don’t want. That, they say, violates President Obama’s pledge that if you like the insurance you have, you can keep it. Mr. Obama clearly misspoke when he said that. HaHaHaHaHa! President Obama misspoke 27 times! And curiously enough, when he misspoke it was the centerpiece of his argument for his supposedly signature legislative achievement! Even the Times editorial board wouldn’t try to sell that one; it’s got to be the Onion. By law, insurers cannot continue to sell policies that don’t provide the minimum benefits and consumer protections required as of next year. So they’ve sent cancellation notices to hundreds of thousands of people who hold these substandard policies. Sure! From now on you can pay extra for pediatric dental coverage, even if you don’t have any kids! , but the 10 million to 12 million people who buy policies directly on the individual market. Here the Onion goes too far. It can’t expect us to believe that the Times editorial board is so ill-informed that it doesn’t realize we are talking about employer-sponsored group plans. As we wrote here, the Obama administration itself calculated, back in 2010, that more than one-half of all employer-sponsored plans will be dropped once Obamacare goes into effect. And that is just in the short term; in the long run, the Obama administration acknowledged that all current plans will be phased out and those covered by them will have to pay more, in some cases with help from the taxpayers or Chinese banks. Still, every good parody goes over the top at some point. Well done, Onion!</td>\n",

Smith’s column puts an exclamation point on the exposure of Obama’s calculated deceit:  On June 15, 2009, Obama said, in one of hundreds of similar statements, “No matter how we reform health care, we will keep this promise to the American people: If you like your doctor, you will be able to keep your doctor, period. If you like your health-care plan, you’ll be able to keep your health-care plan, period. No one will take it away, no matter what.” This wasn’t just bulls – – t. This was a lie.

       "      <td>Public Policy Polling ran a survey here in Minnesota that was reported on in today’s St. Paul Pioneer Press. The political results were predictably dreary; both Mark Dayton and Al Franken are favored for re-election, in part because hardly anyone has heard of any of their prospective GOP opponents. But for some reason, PPP also asked some sports questions, and they found an interesting split with regard to the Minnesota Vikings’ current quarterback controversy. Let’s back up. Two years ago, the Vikings were awful, finishing 3-13. Last year, they surprised everyone by going 10-6 and making the post-season, with Christian Ponder, who played well down the stretch, at the helm. This year the team is off to a poor start, currently 1-6. Ponder started the season at QB; Matt Cassel, a career back-up, has started one game–the only one the Vikings have won so far–and the team signed Josh Freeman when Freeman was cut by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Freeman has started one game, just days after he joined the team. He clearly was not in command of the offense, and looked awful. He also suffered a mild concussion in that game, which put Ponder back in the starting role. So here in Minnesota, we have a quarterback controversy, which is another way of saying we don’t have a very good quarterback. They don’t have quarterback controversies in New England or Denver. With that background, here are PPP’s findings: Ponder is the top QB choice among Republicans, with 34 percent of those polled, while Democrats prefer Josh Freeman, who got 30 percent of those polled. Let’s acknowledge up front that we are dealing at the margin of statistical significance. That said, the question is intriguing: why would Republicans tend to favor Ponder, and Democrats Freeman? Christian Ponder There is one obvious, stereotypical explanation: Republicans favor the guy who has had some success and is a known commodity. Democrats prefer to throw a hail-Mary on a guy who has only played one game, did a pretty horrible job, but has a strong arm and maybe some yet-unseen up-side. That could be the explanation. Josh Freeman But I suspect that something else is going on. It is striking, if you live here in Minnesota and especially if you read comments on stories in the Minneapolis Star Tribune sports pages, how some people hate Christian Ponder. They don’t just think he isn’t a very good quarterback; they don’t merely think he doesn’t have a very good arm. They hate him. Literally. Why? The only analogy I can think of is the way many liberals hate Tim Tebow. As it happens, Christian Ponder is a mini-Tebow. His parents weren’t kidding when they named him. As you might know, he married ESPN football reporter Samantha Steele last year. In this interview, he described Samantha as “a true woman of God.” Those are not, to be honest, the words that occurred to me when I first saw Ms. Steele. There are a number of other religious references in that interview, and most others Ponder has done. Samantha Ponder Is that why some–not all, by any means, but some–Democrats hate Ponder? I suspect that it is. Many liberals, maybe most, are actively anti-religious. They are engaged in a campaign to drive any positive references to religion out of the public sphere. A man like Christian Ponder, in that context, is beyond the pale. They hate him. I would like to be wrong, but I suspect that is what explains the partisan division in Minnesota’s quarterback controversy. For what it is worth, I am not a big pro football fan, but I will be rooting for Ponder and the Vikings tomorrow against the Dallas Cowboys.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Opinion | Impeachment Was Supposed to Protect the 2020 Election. Now, It’s Worse Off.</td>\n",
       "      <td>Lawmakers from both parties have sown doubt that this year’s vote will be free and fair. Here’s how to fix it. By EDWARD B. FOLEY Edward B. Foley directs the Election Law program at the Ohio State University’s Moritz College of Law, where he also holds the Ebersold Chair in constitutional law. President Donald Trump’s impeachment awakened debates about political corruption, foreign aid, executive privilege, the meaning of the Constitution and more. But what the country just went through was fundamentally about something else, as well: the integrity of our elections. Both Republicans and Democrats said their positions on impeachment were intended to protect the 2020 election. Yet, as it ends, the process looks like it could have the opposite effect. American election integrity is at serious risk, not so much because of the outcome of the trial, but because of the way the two sides argued their cases. After resisting calls for Trump’s impeachment for months, fearing the process would be seen as an effort to undo the 2016 election, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi changed her mind because Trump’s Ukraine call was about the next election; Democrats felt they needed to stop Trump from gaining an unfair advantage in 2020 by attempting to enlist a foreign country’s help. Yet, when impeachment moved to the Senate, the House managers argued that unless Trump was removed from office, the 2020 election couldn’t, as Representative Adam Schiff put it, be “assured” of being “fairly won.” This argument suggests that as long as an acquitted Trump is on the ballot in November, there is a risk the election will be unfair, and that its results cannot be trusted as the genuine choice of the American electorate—a recipe for chaos. Republicans, too, said their position on impeachment was meant to protect election integrity, by making sure voters have the opportunity to reelect Trump to a second term if that their electorate’s preference. Yet, many Republicans in Congress joined Trump in claiming that the president had done nothing wrong in trying to recruit Ukraine to undermine Joe Biden as a 2020 electoral opponent. To suggest that an incumbent president can do whatever he wants to win reelection, as long as it is not a crime, is an intolerable position from the perspective of protecting America’s free and fair elections. In other words: Republicans (with a few notable exceptions) have condoned a form of cheating in the presidential race, while the Democratic impeachment managers claim that Trump, even if he makes no further attempts to cheat, already has lost any chance to be a legitimate winner. If both parties genuinely thought they were protecting the electoral process, they have been proved wrong: The prospect of holding an honest election has never seemed so fragile, at least not in modern times. Is there anything we can do about it now? It won’t be easy, especially after the searing experience of the impeachment trial, but if both parties are serious about election integrity, it’s possible to salvage this post-impeachment moment and America’s election process. There is no better time than the aftermath of an intense fight for political leaders to act, and there are a number of practical steps they could take before November. To start, enough Republicans should join Democrats on some sort of official Senate resolution asserting that there need to be limits to presidential mischief in a reelection campaign. While it seems unlikely at this point that the Senate will formally censure Trump over his Ukraine-related misconduct, surely there are at least four GOP votes for a measure that, without mentioning Trump or Ukraine, categorically rejects the “anything goes” argument heading forward. Acquitting the president in order to protect his place on the ballot was one thing, but now that that’s been accomplished for the sake of the party, a few GOP senators for the sake of the country should go on record saying that, for this and future elections, incumbent presidents running for reelection must not seek or allow improper election interference. This sort of Senate resolution could say something as specific as: “It shall henceforth be a high misdemeanor, punishable upon impeachment by removal from office and future disqualification from the same, for a first-term president to exercise powers of the presidency to interfere with the choice of American voters to decide whether or not to reelect the president.” A reasonable debate might be had in the Senate over whether such impeachable behavior should be limited to presidential decisions that directly interfere with voters’ right to cast their ballots—as would be the case, for example, if an incumbent president perniciously ordered federal immigration agents to patrol polling places on Election Day hoping to disenfranchise eligible voters. Alternatively, the impeachable behavior could extend to obtaining assistance, from foreign governments or other recipients of federal funds (like state and local governments), to undermine a potential rival candidate through intentionally deceptive messaging. Either approach, albeit to differing degrees, would put the president on notice that, his acquittal over the Ukraine matter aside, there is presidential misbehavior that the Senate cannot condone. One free pass is not a permanent “get out of jail free” card. While Trump undoubtedly would speak out against any such proclamation, considering it an implicit rebuke to him, it is precisely because he would resist it that the Senate should show some firmness. Deterring Trump from committing misconduct would not be the only, or even the main, purpose of a Senate resolution. It would be a statement of principle from the legislative branch, and if Trump were to violate that principle, it would be a test of whether the Senate would abide by the standard it set for itself. Senators currently can justify their acquittal of Trump on the ground that the “law” of impeachment was murky before the Ukraine matter arose. But once this resolution is on the books, the issue is murky no more. For all of this to mean anything, Democrats also must extend an olive branch: some sort of magnanimous retraction of their position, expressed by House managers, that the 2020 election inherently would lack legitimacy with Trump on the ballot. Think of it as the equivalent of a losing candidate’s concession speech at the end of a hard-fought campaign. Trump won. The Democrats lost, and so they must concede Trump’s ongoing legitimacy as president. Beyond this, the Democrats should acknowledge that if Trump engages in no further “cheating,” then he can win the election fair and square, in which case the Democrats will accept the victory as valid. (This concession speech would come, most meaningfully, from Pelosi, but that seems less likely after her reaction to Trump’s State of the Union speech. It would still be meaningful coming from Schiff as the lead House manager.) Beyond such efforts at reconciliation, there are additional bipartisan steps Congress could take to put election integrity on firmer footing. Recall that a minimal degree of bipartisan cooperation is necessary to complete any presidential election; the House and Senate must come together for a special joint session to count the electoral votes from the states and declare the winner. In order to shore up voters’ confidence that this year’s election will be conducted fairly, Congress, as well as organizations of state-level election officials, between now and November should expressly recognize the necessity for bipartisanship in the administration of the election. Furthermore, given the current political atmosphere, it is highly likely that partisans on one side or the other—or both simultaneously—will challenge the legitimacy of the electoral process as it unfolds this fall. “Rigged,” someone will shout, or tweet. “Cheating,” someone else will say, echoing the language of impeachment. The initial reactions to the technological failures in this week’s Iowa caucuses—namely, observers who jumped to the conclusion that the results themselves were compromised, even though there was no evidence of that—is an early warning sign that America needs help in navigating what’s correct and incorrect about the process of counting votes. If and when there are charges of voter suppression or miscounted ballots this fall, it would be good to have in place a bipartisan body, even if only advisory in nature, to assess whether the charges are founded and merit formal investigation, while helping to diffuse confusion and controversy. Ideally, the panel would be established by Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Alternatively, any two Senators from opposite sides of the aisle could step up (how about Lamar Alexander and Tim Kaine?), or ex-presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, given the advisory nature of the enterprise. Even short of creating this kind of advisory body, Congress would do well to hold hearings on the kind of challenges the electoral process might face in the fall. Although there have been hearings about cybersecurity and foreign interference, less attention has been paid to the basic concept of conducting a free and fair election in a hyperpolarized environment. Some resulting, narrowly targeted statutory fixes would be especially valuable. For example, Congress could clarify that the existing prohibition on the deployment of federal military troops at polling places applies to other “armed” federal personnel as well, even if they are Homeland Security, rather that Defense Department, troops. Despite all the pitfalls that this impeachment now poses for a successful 2020 election, the vote in November still can be successful—meaning it accords with the will of the American electorate, whichever candidate wins, and is accepted by both sides as legitimate. But just as failure is not inevitable (despite what some Democrats might say), success also is not guaranteed. And the impeachment process, in the immediate aftermath of Trump’s acquittal, makes success more difficult and uncertain. If both Republicans and Democrats in Congress are serious about their rhetoric over the past few months—that theirs is the party that cares about election integrity—Congress should step up to show the American electorate the two parties are still capable of conducting a free and fair election. That is not too much to ask.</td>\n",

       "      <td>History Dept. We knew how this would end. We asked historians and impeachment experts how it will all look in 50 years. The monthslong impeachment process that ended Wednesday could feel like a blur of news and political theater all leading up to a foregone conclusion. Donald Trump is still the president. Americans’ confidence in the whole political process, whatever their party, is still dented. So what did we all just live through? Throughout the impeachment proceedings, POLITICO Magazine convened a panel of experts on the rare and dramatic event called impeachment. In response to the acquittal vote, we asked them to look into the future and offer one more insight: How will the history books look back on this moment? What was it all for—the rhetoric, the ceremony, the investigations, the defense, the taxpayer money? We asked them to spice their expertise with some imagination and write a paragraph from the history books of 2070, the one describing the impeachment process’ lasting effects on American government and politics. Depending on which universe we end up with in 2070, the impeachment will have accelerated the political rise of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, “ushered in the age of the imperial presidency,” or “sounded the death knell of impeachment as a bulwark against an outlaw president,” according to the experts. Read on for more. Michael Kimmage is a professor of history at the Catholic University of America and author of The Abandonment of the West: The History of an Idea in American Foreign Policy, which is due out with Basic Books in April 2020. The Trump era began with Trump’s election in 2016, hit a high point with his acquittal on impeachment in 2020 and ended with President Mike Pompeo’s 2028 loss to the young Midwestern Governor Tom Wilkinson. In many ways, the Trump era was a period of stasis: Few major alterations were made to the economy, which grew at a modest rate, and the foreign policy of this period amounted to muddling through with no broad vision. The “Trump era” might just as well be called the era of disunity among Democrats. Their drive to impeach President Donald Trump in 2020 not only failed in a practical sense but also overestimated the degree of popular support behind the party, which depended on the defection of Trump supporters for victory—and such victories proved elusive. In the 2020 presidential election, memories of impeachment left the Democrats isolated, and Trump’s reelection—this time with former Secretary of State Pompeo as his running mate—threw them into disarray, their leadership hobbled by intraparty blame. A second impeachment attempt, after the Trump administration was persuasively implicated in voting irregularities in the 2022 midterm elections, also resulted in failure, boosting Pompeo’s political fortunes. After his election in 2024, President Pompeo, regarded by most as lacking the charisma of his predecessor, struggled to command the attention and the affection of Trump’s supporters, who missed the style and the personality of the 45th president. Many of those supporters stayed at home on Election Day in 2024 and 2028. In 2028, enough stayed home to cost Pompeo the election. Upon his election in 2028, President Wilkerson was able to change gears on domestic political matters, but he was the first president who had to contend with the costly foreign-policy drift of the previous 12 years. He was the first president who could not ignore the rise of India, the obvious focal point of 21st-century geopolitics. Claire Potter is co-executive editor at Public Seminar and professor of history at The New School for Social Research. In 2020, when the House Democratic majority brought the impeachment case against Trump to the Senate, it was a consensus view among triumphant Republicans that acquittal meant impeachment had failed. Many Democrats also had doubts. Had the process been too narrowly focused on Trump’s attempt to promote an investigation into a 2020 political rival? Should the process have been slower—and should it have followed leads embedded in the 2019 Mueller report into Russian election interference? Did the timing of the impeachment and subsequent trial, which pulled three leading Democratic presidential candidates off the campaign trail, skew the primary process to privilege moderate candidates like former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg and former New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg? But was impeachment a failure? Today, the consensus among historians is mostly no. No impeached American president had ever been removed from office at the time of the 2020 impeachment, yet this did not keep Congress from playing its constitutional role at the time. And at a moment in U.S. history when constitutional checks and balances were most vulnerable to presidential overreach, Democrats in Congress—however imperfectly—signaled their determination to play their role to check and balance the executive branch. Mary Frances Berry is the Geraldine R. Segal Professor of American Social Thought and professor of history at the University of Pennsylvania. She is the author of 12 books, including Why ERA Failed: Politics, Women's Rights, and the Amending Process of the Constitution. The House of Representatives, increasingly disgusted with his policies on immigration and other matters and his crude political style, impeached Trump in 2019. The House acted, knowing that conviction was unlikely in the Republican-majority Senate. Trump, who had been elected by the Electoral College but did not win the popular vote, displayed commitment to his base and his campaign promises, no matter how problematic, and made little effort to seduce his opposition or to broaden his support. The Senate deliberations over the House’s charges gave Democrats a brief respite from their Republican colleagues’ almost daily votes confirming more judges to the federal courts for life. After Trump’s acquittal, he seemed unchastened by the impeachment episode and was easily reelected as his trade deals and low unemployment kept the economy in good shape. Thereafter, most objections to successive presidents remained in the realm of disputes over policy and how opponents could win in the next election. As for most of our history, impeachment lie dormant, still available but mostly ignored. Alan Baron is former special impeachment counsel to the U.S. House of Representatives. The impeachment and subsequent acquittal by the Senate of Trump in 2020 sounded the death knell of impeachment as a bulwark against an outlaw president. Impeachment has always been a blend of legal and political process. In Trump’s case, the political considerations obliterated the legal and constitutional framework. Trump was charged in two articles of impeachment. The first alleged he abused his power when he ordered the withholding of critical military assistance from an embattled ally, Ukraine, unless the president of that country announced an investigation into a political rival, Joe Biden. The second article alleged he obstructed Congress by blocking the production of witnesses and documents sought by the House as part of its investigation. As a result of the president’s action, no witnesses and no documents were produced at his trial. This action precluded the testimony of former national security adviser John Bolton, who, it was reported just days before the conclusion of the trial, had written in a book draft that he was told by Trump that aid to Ukraine would be withheld unless it announced an investigation into the Bidens. This decision by the Republican majority in the Senate not to call witnesses and, indeed, not to impeach Trump and remove him from office, bore bitter fruit in the long run. The case demonstrated that impeachment was not an effective means to remove a chief executive for even the most egregious misconduct by a president in the nation’s history. While most attention was focused on Article One, acquittal on the second article proved even more pernicious in the long run, obliterating the investigative function of Congress. As a result, after Trump came the age of the imperial presidency. David Blight is Sterling Professor of History, of African American studies and of American studies at Yale University. The impeachment and acquittal of Trump in 2020 left the country’s political culture in spiraling decline. For the portion of the country’s politically engaged population that was not securely within the Fox News universe, the Trump acquittal demonstrated the sheer cravenness of the Republican Party. Republicans continued to be seen in the 2020s as the party of white people, of a white nationalist, of a xenophobic vision of America that flew in the face of reality: an increasingly multiethnic, multiracial, multireligious nation. The Democratic Party also frayed into divisions between left and right. Democrats managed to defeat Trump in 2020, decisively in the popular vote but only narrowly in the Electoral College—vulnerable to charges even then that it was an archaic institution. After his defeat in 2020, Trump cut a lucrative deal with Fox News and appeared on the channel three nights per week in prime time, stoking a racist, nationalist vision of the country, while the country divided and fragmented into increasingly identity-based groups. The United States also continued to decline as a world power, losing influence in international organizations and in global economics. American institutions and corporations went into decline, and the country lost its place in the world as a model republic. Trumpism had become the watchword for American decline. By the end of the 2020s, more voters than ever identified as independent. Attempts to establish third parties surged. In 2027, a movement for a new constitutional convention succeeded. The resulting constitutional amendments to eliminate the Electoral College and to reorganize the U.S. Senate into a more democratic institution just barely failed to pass in three quarters of state legislatures for approval. Allan J. Lichtman is a history professor and author of The Case for Impeachment. The evolving defense of their client by Trump’s lawyers threatened the foundation of the democratic republic. First, his lawyers said that Trump had done nothing wrong. Second, they argued that abuse of power is not impeachable. The defense ended by asserting that the president could do anything he wants (short of an indictable crime) to assure his election. “Every public official that I know believes that his election is in the public interest,” said the president’s handpicked constitutional expert, Alan Dershowitz, on the Senate floor. “If a president does something which he believes will help him get elected in the public interest, that cannot be the kind of quid pro quo that results in impeachment.” This doctrine, which Dershowitz failed to corroborate with any judicial or scholarly authority, turned America into a sham democracy. It represented what the founders feared most about a rogue president and why they advisedly put impeachment into the Constitution. Influential framer Gouverneur Morris said, “The Executive ought therefore to be impeachable for treachery and corrupting his electors.” James Madison warned that a president might “betray his trust to foreign powers.” With Trump’s acquittal, without hearing from a single witness or the White House producing a single document, it became precedent for every president to corrupt our elections, as long as they avoided violating the criminal code. The acquittal enabled one president to use his legal declassification prerogative to give our nuclear secrets to Russia and China as a quid pro quo for their help in his reelection. It enabled another to order his Department of Justice to investigate his political opponents, including journalists and members of Congress. A president has “constitutional authority to tell the Justice Department who to investigate, who not to investigate,” Dershowitz said in a 2017 interview. This impeachment process began with Russian President Vladimir Putin’s interference in the 2016 election that Trump welcomed and exploited. It ended with a doctrine that would turn America into an autocracy. Brooks Simpson is a history professor at Arizona State University. Trump’s acquittal came as no surprise, but its long-term impact proved counterintuitive. The claims made by the president and his defenders that there were virtually no restraints on presidential power so long as the president could claim a public purpose became a mantra among his successors, while the bitter partisanship that had characterized the impeachment process reached new extremes, effectively paralyzing the policy process in perpetual stalemate. No one could argue that the Trump presidency was a momentary aberration: The logic of the president’s defenders presaged an executive unleashed as well as unhinged. Faced with a crisis of political legitimacy, political leaders from both parties moved quickly to reverse course. They labored to construct new constraints on executive power and revamped the cumbersome impeachment process. The result was a major restructuring of Article II of the Constitution that fashioned explicit restraints on presidential power in an effort to reestablish the effective use of checks and balances, as well as a restructuring of the Electoral College that forever ended the “winner-take-all” practice in favor of the proportional awarding of votes. This promoted the emergence of new parties that challenged Republican-Democratic hegemony and encouraged coalition building to secure majority approval of legislation. American politics would never be the same: It had entered a new era, a transformation attributable to Trump’s acquittal. Jeremi Suri is a professor of history and public affairs at the University of Texas at Austin. He is the author of The Impossible Presidency: The Rise and Fall of America’s Highest Office. The acquittal of Trump marked the end of the Republican Party—a party that had stood for a strong union, rule of law and a firm foreign policy since its founding a century and a half earlier. Trump’s crimes violated each of these values, but the elected officials in the party rallied to defend him nonetheless. Although public opinion was split on the wisdom of removing the president through impeachment, three-quarters of Americans thought the trial should include witnesses, suggesting that most of those thought the impeachment trial was unfair. Defined now by a criminal president, the Republican Party became a legacy institution with rapidly diminishing support among every growing demographic of citizens in the United States. A new party of free market, socially moderate, “good government” conservatives, known as the National Union Party, quickly emerged to supplant the Republican Party in the largest states, and then the nation as a whole. The acquittal of Trump was the fatal conviction of the Republican Party. Kim Wehle is a CBS News legal analyst and a former assistant U.S. attorney and associate independent counsel for the Whitewater investigation. I fear that this impeachment could mark the end of the separation of powers and a legitimate democratic republic in America. The stakes could not be higher. When Trump lawyer Alan Dershowitz admitted that Trump’s team endorsed kinglike powers—where a president’s view of what is best for him personally is per se good for America and thus beyond congressional and judicial reproach—I felt a sigh of relief that the truth was finally on the table. When Dershowitz—who is not a constitutional scholar, but a criminal law professor and defense lawyer—validated that view, Senate Republicans could have felt some relief too; finally they had political cover from an academic for voting to greenlight unlimited presidential power. I fear we will look back in 50 years and see a deterioration of individual rights as a result of this presidency: people investigated and prosecuted for defying the party in power, attacks on and silencing of the press, additional manipulation of foreign governments to entrench power in the White House, and maybe worse. People still naively say, “Never in America.“ But the framers knew that, without real checks and balances, human nature won’t self-regulate to protect against abuses of power. With this impeachment, those checks on the presidency are all but gone. Possibly for good.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Our political culture has allowed its muscles of accountability to atrophy. President Donald Trump delivers the State of the Union. | Leah Millis-Pool/Getty Images By JOHN F. HARRIS Altitude is a column by POLITICO founding editor John Harris, offering weekly perspective on politics in a moment of radical disruption. President Donald Trump is acquitted, but the consensus view—shared by nearly all Democrats and even a decent number of Republicans—is that the United States Senate did nothing to acquit itself. Wednesday’s vote—anticipated with near-perfect precision since the opening hours of the Ukraine scandal in September—has yielded a new indictment: The partisan divisions that saved Trump are an expression of deeper and malignant trends that are a threat to constitutional democracy. By all means count me in for mournful sermons about the poor civic hygiene of America in the Age of Trump. The patient is indeed sick. But it is not because the pulse of democracy is growing faint. To the contrary, the fundamental problem of modern political culture is the erosion of accountability. Politicians have shown repeatedly the ability to escape consequences by reframing almost any controversy away from the particulars of misbehavior to the familiar question: Which side are you on, mine or my enemies'? In this dynamic, democracy—or at least the rancid brand of it we have been practicing lately—is as much culprit as victim. In the Trump-Ukraine matter, both the partisan House vote to impeach and the partisan Senate vote to acquit were, in broad terms, a faithful reflection of popular will. It is the nature of popular will—bitterly cleaved, indifferent to facts except as they can be employed as weapon or shield—that is the challenge. We can add to this another defining trait of contemporary culture: shredded attention spans. On this score, the news media and their audience—certainly myself and most likely you—share culpability with craven politicians. For now, let’s examine what we are indignant about today. My colleague Myah Ward crunched some numbers on the Senate vote. The 48 senators who voted to convict (lone Republican Mitt Romney plus all Democrats and independents Bernie Sanders and Angus King) represent states with 171.4 million Americans. The 52 Republicans who voted to acquit represent states with 156 million Americans. (For the 10 states whose senators voted different directions, Ward allocated half of the state’s population to each side.) That’s a difference of 15.2 million people, less than 5 percent of the total population. Senators voting to convict won their most recent elections with a total of 69.4 million votes, compared to 48.1 million for their main opponents. Senators voting to acquit won 57.7 million votes in their most recent elections, compared to about 45 million for their main opponents. I’m drawing no grand analytical conclusions from Ward’s math, merely observing that they seem roughly to approximate recent polls on how Americans approached the Senate trial. In recent years, progressives have grown increasingly impatient with the constitutional features designed to buffer majoritarianism and protect the interests of states, even when those interests are at odds with popular sentiment nationally. Liberal frustration is understandable. The past two Republican presidents won first terms while losing the popular vote. The intentional dilution of pure democracy in the Senate—Wyoming’s 600,000 people get two senators, as do California’s 40 million—is growing starker each year. David Birdsell, dean of the school of public and international affairs at Baruch College in New York, has done research projecting that in 20 years, 70 percent of Americans will live in the 15 largest states, meaning that 30 percent of Americans will be represented by 70 senators. His findings were publicized by the Wall Street Journal’s Gerald Seib. These structural distortions may well be a long-term problem for constitutional democracy. But there isn’t much in the impeachment ordeal that advances this argument in the short term. A POLITICO/Morning Consult poll last week found 50 percent approval for removing Trump from office and 43 percent disapproval. A composite of polls by FiveThirtyEight found that 84 percent of Democrats, 42 percent of independents and 9 percent of Republicans wanted Trump removed from office. This averaged out just under 48 percent of all Americans—by coincidence, the very number of senators voting to remove. So failure to reflect democracy’s will isn’t the problem. In fact, Romney, not used to being extolled by Democrats, took his vote to convict in apparent defiance of the Utah Republicans who sent him to the Senate. In doing so, and in his brutal words about Trump’s conduct in attempting to use military aid as leverage to induce Ukraine to investigate the Biden family, Romney was doing something rare: saying what he honestly thought based on his own notions of right and wrong, rather than calculating his words around political consequences. (This was also rare for Romney, who in the past has flipped his views on core issues like abortion rights and making health insurance mandatory based on political imperatives.) Romney, in his floor speech, said his fellow Republicans were casting different votes in good faith. That’s a generous appraisal. It is impossible to believe that Senate Republicans would think it would be fine if a President Hillary Clinton had linked military aid to her domestic political needs or even that they would be disturbed by this but think impeachment is excessive. The question is imponderable. But one paradox of the past 30 years is that the various legal and political instruments to investigate, expose, and punish misbehavior of people in power have not made it harder to get away with questionable behavior. They have made it easier. President Bill Clinton was investigated for years over obscure business dealings in the Whitewater affair that took place a decade before he came to power. His decision to replace the White House travel office was a controversy that echoed for his first term. The fundraising that allowed foreign money to seep into his reelection coffers was not merely unseemly; House Speaker Newt Gingrich called it “the opening phase of what will turn out to be the largest scandal in American history.” Twenty years later, it is worth recalling the matters that have only briefly dented headlines during the Trump years, or in some cases barely dented them at all. Recall that Trump is the first president in the modern era to not release his taxes, and he is facing inquiries over his inaugural committee’s overseas contributions and its contracts at his hotels and his personal foundation’s unfulfilled pledges of donations to worthy causes. He has seen the criminal convictions of his campaign manager, his first national security adviser and his personal lawyer. He has confronted allegations of self-dealing or misuse of taxpayer funds among officials at his health department, EPA, and Transportation Department, among others. These and other matters briefly cause an uproar, or not, then fade from consciousness of the opposition party, of the news media, of the public. This inability to give sustained focus on ethical matters that an earlier generation would have commanded national attention for months or years is not a structural challenge of the Constitution. Nor it is a thwarting of democracy. It is the expression of a democracy that has allowed its muscles of accountability to atrophy.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Rachel Bitecofer’s radical new theory predicted the midterms spot-on. So who’s going to win 2020? David Freedlander writes about politics and culture. He lives in New York. To the political scientist Rachel Bitecofer, all of that is almost certainly true, and that has made her one of the most intriguing new figures in political forecasting this year. Bitecofer, a 42-year-old professor at Christopher Newport University in the Hampton Roads area of Virginia, was little known in the extremely online, extremely male-dominated world of political forecasting until November 2018. That’s when she nailed almost to the number the nature and size of the Democrats’ win in the House, even as other forecasters went wobbly in the race’s final days. Not only that, but she put out her forecast back in July, and then stuck by it while polling shifted throughout the summer and fall. And today her model tells her the Democrats are a near lock for the presidency in 2020, and are likely to gain House seats and have a decent shot at retaking the Senate. If she’s right, we are now in a post-economy, post-incumbency, post record-while-in-office era of politics. Her analysis, as Bitecofer puts it with characteristic immodesty, amounts to nothing less than “flipping giant paradigms of electoral theory upside down.” Her analysis, as Bitecofer puts it with characteristic immodesty, amounts to nothing less than “flipping giant paradigms of electoral theory upside down.” Bitecofer’s theory, when you boil it down, is that modern American elections are rarely shaped by voters changing their minds, but rather by shifts in who decides to vote in the first place. To her critics, she’s an extreme apostle of the old saw that “turnout explains everything,” taking a long victory lap after getting lucky one time. She sees things slightly differently: That the last few elections show that American politics really has changed, and other experts have been slow to process what it means. If she’s right, it wouldn’t just blow up the conventional wisdom; it would mean that much of the lucrative cottage industry of political experts—the consultants and pollsters and (ahem) the reporters—is superfluous, an army of bit players with little influence over the outcome. Actually, worse than superfluous: That whole industry of experts is generally wrong. The classic view is that the pool of American voters is basically fixed: About 55 percent of eligible voters are likely to go to the polls, and the winner is determined by the 15 percent or so of “swing voters” who flit between the parties. So a general election campaign amounts to a long effort to pull those voters in to your side. Bitecofer has a nickname for this view. She calls it, with disdain, the “Chuck Todd theory of American politics”: “The idea that there is this informed, engaged American population that is watching these political events and watching their elected leaders and assessing their behavior and making a judgment.” “And it is just not true.” A few of the newly elected members of the House take a selfie outside the Capitol during their week in Washington last November for orientation meetings. | Win McNamee/Getty Images Election forecasting has existed at least as long as there have been elections. In the 15th century, there were betting odds on who would emerge the winner of the next papal conclave. By the end of the 19th century, newspapers were asking readers to cut out makeshift ballots and mail them to the newsroom in order to get a preview of the election outcome. In recent years polling has grown more sophisticated, as has poll analysis: Pity the poor rube these days who cites a mere poll instead of a “polling average.” Alongside the enthusiasm for polls has grown a serious academic interest in predicting elections. Unlike polling, academic forecasters tend to use the state of the world on Election Day to determine who is going to win. An improving GDP? It means an X-point advantage for the incumbent. Two (or more) terms in power for a single party, and that’s an electoral drag. In 2016, the pollsters had the race largely wrong, but the academic forecasters got it mostly right, even though many ended up doubting their formulas after they spat out a likely victory for Trump, since such an outcome seemed impossible. But even the more academic forecasts, like the polling models, are based on longstanding assumptions about why and how candidates win elections. And sometimes an event occurs that blows up those assumptions. In Bitecofer’s experience, that event wasn’t Trump; it was the Tea Party. She was still a graduate student in 2010 when a wave of conservative populism returned the Republicans to power in the House. According to any conventional theory of politics, that wave made no sense. Two years prior the GOP had run the economy into the ground; under a Democratic president and a fully Democratic Congress, the economy had stopped its slide and begun to recover. How could the Democrats lose 63 seats in a brutal shellacking two years after totally routing the Republicans? The prevailing analysis was that Democrats had overreached on policy: After Obamacare, the stimulus, the bank and auto bailouts, the center just revolted. But when Americans picked a president in 2012, they didn’t seem so appalled; Obama won again. The 2014 midterms confounded the polls; the generic ballot heading into Election Day had the two parties basically tied in the national generic ballot, but when the votes came in, the Republicans added seats to their House majority and routed the Democrats in the Senate, picking up nine seats. For most election forecasters, these results meant more data, and they went back and tweaked their models. For Bitecofer, at the beginning of her career, they became the foundation of her thinking. She was something of an outsider from the start; she had grown up a Navy brat, mostly in the D.C. area, and spent her youth following the Grateful Dead and Widespread Panic, reading The New York Times in the parking lot between shows. She was living in Eugene, Oregon, a single mom at a dead-end administrative job at a Republican polling firm, when she heard Rachel Maddow on Air America mention her doctorate in political science. “I was like, ‘Wait, you can study politics?’” she says. She enrolled in community college, then the University of Oregon, then on to the University of Georgia for a Ph.D., and was soon hired by Christopher Newport University to work in its public-policy division. (She has since been hired away by the Niskanen Center, a centrist think tank based in Washington, D.C., while maintaining her academic post.) Rachel Bitecofer has a decorative nameplate on her desk at Christopher Newport University. | Julia Rendleman for Politico Magazine In 2016, the election that truly embarrassed the experts, Bitecofer was teaching in her new job and didn’t put together a forecast. She doesn’t pretend she saw it coming: She says she was as surprised Trump won as anyone else, but what struck her in examining the results, and what she saw as getting lost in the postelection commentary, was exactly how many people voted third party—for the Greens, the Libertarians or Evan McMullin, a former CIA operative who was running on behalf of the “Never Trump” wing of the Republican Party. Hillary Clinton had run an entire campaign built around classic assumptions: She was trying to pick off Republicans and Republican-leaning independents appalled by Trump. So she chose a bland white man, Tim Kaine, as a running mate; it also explained her policy-lite messaging and her ads. But in the end, almost all of those voters stuck with the GOP. The voters who voted third party should have been Democratic voters—they were disproportionately young, diverse and college educated—but they were turned off by the divisive Democratic primary, and the Clinton camp made no effort to activate them in the general election. As she delved further into the data on 2016, Bitecofer noticed something else. As much as the media had harped on the narrative that a majority of white women had voted for Trump, the election also signaled the first time that a majority of college-educated white men had voted for the Democratic Party. There was a long-term-realignment happening in America, and 2016 had accelerated it. Part of Bitecofer’s job involved polling Virginia, and she saw a Democratic counterwave building there in 2017. She noted to Democrats in the state that they should spend resources in areas that had traditionally been off limits. Had they done so, Bitecofer says, they could have flipped the Legislature that year. (Instead it flipped in 2019.) When 2018 rolled around, she saw what was coming: “College educated white men, and especially college educated white women,” she said, “were going to be on fucking fire.” It didn’t matter who was running; it mattered who was voting. From there, the model followed. She put out her forecast for the general election when there were still candidates battling it out in primaries. Bitecofer’s view of the electorate is driven, in part, by a new way to think about why Americans vote the way they do. She counts as an intellectual mentor Alan Abramowitz, a professor of political science at Emory University who popularized the concept of “negative partisanship,” the idea that voters are more motivated to defeat the other side than by any particular policy goals. In a piece explaining his work in POLITICO Magazine, Abramowitz wrote: “Over the past few decades, American politics has become like a bitter sports rivalry, in which the parties hang together mainly out of sheer hatred of the other team, rather than a shared sense of purpose. Republicans might not love the president, but they absolutely loathe his Democratic adversaries. And it’s also true of Democrats, who might be consumed by their internal feuds over foreign policy and the proper role of government were it not for Trump.” Bitecofer took this insight and mapped it across the country. As she sees it, it isn’t quite right to refer to a Democratic or Republican “base.” Rather, there are Democratic and Republican coalitions, the first made of people of color, college-educated whites and people in metropolitan areas; the second, mostly noncollege whites, with a smattering of religious-minded voters, financiers and people in business, largely in rural and exurban counties. “In the polarized era, the outcome isn’t really about the candidates. What matters is what percentage of the electorate is Republican and Republican leaners, and what percentage is Democratic and Democratic leaners, and how they get activated,” she said. Accordingly, she believed that whom the Democrats nominated didn’t matter much, and while the rest of the country focused on the districts where Hillary Clinton defeated Trump, she thought those were already mostly in the bag, and so focused instead on the 20 or so districts where Trump performed worse than Mitt Romney had in 2012. Those were places with latent Democratic possibility, and had the national party recognized it earlier, they could have flipped even more seats. Since she was new on the forecasting scene, having sat out the 2016 election, Bitecofer took to Twitter, where she had a mere 600-odd followers, and started flogging her analysis relentlessly. “I decided I’d market it on Twitter by being kind of like this clunky annoying little sister on all the big threads. I would jump on Nate Cohn and Nate Silver threads to promote the forecast. And it was just when the generic ballot was starting to narrow and all the other analysts were saying, ‘Oh the Democrats are going to screw this up. They are overreaching. They are going to get 23 seats if they are lucky.’ And I just came out swinging.” “She has taken a Krassenstein Brothers approach at getting attention for her forecasts. In my view that is unfair to the many thoughtful forecasters who don’t relentlessly self-promote.” And while other forecasters picked a range, Bitecofer picked a number—42, only one more than the actual number of seats Democrats ended up winning in the House. (As other forecasters saw the Democrats’ chances dropping, she revised it upward in the race’s waning days, saying in the final week that the Democrats would net 45 seats.) The forecast, and the relentless Twitter-hyping, brought her recognition. The woman who decided to get a degree in political science because she heard Rachel Maddow on the radio was suddenly on Rachel Maddow’s network. In the MSNBC Green Room before a guest appearance on “The Last Word with Lawrence O’Donnell,” she wrote on the chalkboard: “Rachel’s Bucket List: Make it to MSNBC Green Room.” Bitecofer’s approach to getting noticed did not endear her to many people in the insular world of elections forecasting, where a certain modesty and an ethos of letting the work speak for itself prevails. “She has taken a Krassenstein Brothers approach at getting attention for her forecasts,” says the election forecaster Dave Wasserman, House editor of the Cook Political Report, referring to the pair of anti-Trump bros who gained over a million Twitter followers between them, mostly by being some of the first people to reply to Trump tweets and by stirring up #Resistance memes. “In my view that is unfair to the many thoughtful forecasters who don’t relentlessly self-promote.” He questions her central idea—that elections are won by turnout, and by people entering and exiting the electorate rather than by switching sides—as one that simply ignores many basic observations about how politics works. “The idea that turnout explains every election result, I am sorry, but that is just factually not true,” said Wasserman. “There are a significant number of persuadable voters who bounce back and forth between the two parties depending on the candidates and depending on the year. And there are absolutely millions of voters who voted for Donald Trump in 2016 and for a Democratic congressional candidate in 2018 and did so because they were persuaded by Democratic campaign outreach. “She would be well-served as an analyst,” Wasserman added, “if she visited some of the counties in Iowa which voted overwhelmingly for Obama and then overwhelmingly for Trump. These are not places where turnout explains the results. She would learn that persuasion and swing voters are the dominant variable in presidential elections, particularly in those battleground states.” Bitecofer, as it happens, flew to Iowa for three days before and after the caucuses, a few weeks after I spoke to Wasserman—and rejects the criticism that somehow getting out in the world would improve her modeling. If she allowed personal conversations to influence her work, she said, then “I would be a god-fucking awful quantitative scientist.” As for the overall role of those voters, she maintains that actual swing voters are a small percentage of the result, even in counties where the vote swing is as large as Wasserman describes. Don’t talk to people in the bleachers of rallies; check the voter file, she says. “It would be one thing if that county had 100,000 people in it who voted in 2012, and then it was the same 100,000 who voted in 2016, but that is not what is happening,” she says. “The pool of who shows up changes.” Signs in Boone County, Iowa, for Obama and Trump in 2012 and 2016, respectively. Boone is one of a number of counties that flipped parties between the two presidential elections. | Getty Images One of the problems with this approach, or with election forecasting in general, is that it doesn’t necessarily tell us very much about specifics. The Democrats are in a fractious primary at the moment. Knowing who would fare better against Donald Trump would be useful, but Bitecofer’s models don’t say. Election forecasting that uses sociological data is a blunt instrument in a nation where 138 million people vote across 50 states scattered across a continent, each with its own way of administering the process. “It’s the big discussion in election forecasting and political science right now,” said Kyle Kondik, communications director at the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics and an editor at its forecasting site, Sabato’s Crystal Ball. “As I look at it, there are just a lot of different things going on in the electorate. There are a lot of folks who switched from Obama 2012 to Trump 2016. I think that’s pretty clear, but there also were turnout problems for Democrats in these places, and you had people switching or defecting to third parties. The more you learn about this stuff, the less you feel like you have a grasp on it.” Sam Wang, a neuroscientist at Princeton University who since 2004 has doubled as an elections forecaster, and who famously ate a cricket on live television to make up for his erroneous 2016 forecast declaring Clinton the all-but certain winner, agrees. The percentage of people who swing in and out of the electorate is closer to 10 percent, according to his data, which couldn’t explain the massive swings some counties saw from 2012 to 2016. As for Bitecofer’s overall theory, Wang says, “It is the detailed version of something that is generally appreciated—that over the last 20 years the big phenomenon in American politics is that Americans have become much more predictable about who they vote for,” he said. “The broad insight is the deep truth of our time, but it is not that novel.” Bitecofer hasn’t exactly been clairvoyant: Her original Senate prediction was off in 2018. She didn’t anticipate the surge in GOP turnout that would match the surge in Democratic turnout in places where the demographics still favored Republicans. She thought Democrats would win Florida, and maybe even Texas, and that the Georgia governor’s race was winnable. What she didn’t count on at the time was that negative partisanship can work both ways, even when there is one party in power, and that no one knows how to fire up the fear factor in his coalition quite like Donald Trump. He did just that, and Blue Dog Democrats in Missouri and Indiana and North Dakota were done for. But still, the results bore out her theory: For Democrats to win, they need to fire up Democratic-minded voters. The Blue Dogs who tried to narrow the difference between themselves and Trump did worse, overall, than the Stacey Abramses and Beto O’Rourkes, whose progressive ideas and inspirational campaigns drove turnout in their own parties and brought them to the cusp of victory. If you buy Bitecofer’s view of the 2018 midterms—or even, in its milder form, Sam Wang’s point about predictability—you also need to rethink what American elections actually mean now. “I am arguing radical shit, OK?” Bitecofer told me over a series of phone calls over the past several weeks in her Virginia office. “What I am saying is that almost all of this shit is set in stone for three years, that almost none of the shit that people are hanging onto, in terms of daily articles, or polls, or the economy or incumbency or ideology is really worth that much.” When Democrats swept into power in the House of Representatives in the 2018 midterms, they did so, they told themselves, because they mostly ignored Donald Trump. Believing that they needed to win over “Obama/Trump voters,” the Democrats ran a bunch of apolitical military veterans, and focused their campaigns on preserving the Affordable Care Act’s protections of people with preexisting health conditions. Armed with this mandate, they governed accordingly, passing laws (all of which died in the Senate, of course) to lower the price of prescription drugs, raise the minimum wage and curb the power of money in politics. “The broad insight is the deep truth of our time, but it is not that novel.” But the electorate that elected Donald Trump in 2016 and the electorate that gave Democrats control of the House in 2018 might as well have been from two different countries, Bitecofer says. The first was whiter, had less college education and lived in more rural parts of the country than the second, which was more diverse, better educated and more urban than its counterpart from two years prior. That change had nothing to do with Democrats luring swing voters with savvy messaging, and everything to do with a bunch of people, who were appalled by the president, showing up at the polls, wanting to make their feelings known. Once you know the shape of the electorate, she argues, you can pretty much tell how that electorate is going to vote. And the shape of the electorate in 2018, and 2020, for that matter, was determined on the night of November 8, 2016. The new electorate, as she forecasts it, is made up mostly of people who want a president named anything but Donald Trump, competing with another group that fears ruin should anyone but Donald Trump be president. The first group, the Democratic universe of voters, now includes some very strange bedfellows, everyone from former Bush speechwriter David Frum to Susan Sarandon. It includes Al Sharpton and also the chief strategists for both Mitt Romney and John McCain’s failed presidential bids. It is Americans who are college-educated, who are not white or who live in or near a major urban center. This group turned out in force in the 2018 midterms, much the same way Tea Party voters showed up in 2010 to express their unhappiness at Obama. The more candidates talked about Trump and what a threat he was to their way of life, the more partisans were activated. Although the ranks of independents are growing, up to 40 percent by some surveys, Bitecofer says campaigns have spent entirely too much time courting them, and the media has spent entirely too much caring about their preferences. The real “swing” doesn’t come from voters who choose between two parties, she argues, but from people who choose to vote, or not (or, if they do vote, vote for a third party). The actual percentage of swing voters in any given national election according to her own analysis is closer to 6 or 7 percent than the 15 or 20 most analysts think are out there, and that larger group, Bitecofer says, are “closet partisans” who don’t identify with a party but still vote with one. (The remaining 6 percent or so of true independents, she says, tend to vote for whoever promises a break with the status quo.) “If you think of independents as a fixed pool of voters that change preferences,” she says, “well, that has implications for how you campaign after them. But if you are talking about the preference of independents changing because the pool of independents changes, well that is a different fucking banana.” In 2012, Bitecofer points out, Obama actually lost independents while winning the election, and in Ohio, he lost them by 10 points, but still carried the crucial swing state. There are just simply more Democrats in much of the country, and if they are activated by a belief that, say, the Republican presidential nominee is a heartless plutocrat who thinks 47 percent of the population can be written off as grifters and that corporations are people, and the Democrat gets just a handful of those true independents, then it becomes impossible for Republicans to win. Bitecofer has already released her 2020 model, and is alone among election forecasters in giving the Democrats—who, of course, do not yet have a nominee—the 270 electoral votes required to claim the presidency without a single toss-up state flipping their way. She sees anyone in the top tier, or even the second tier of candidates, as strong enough to win back most of the Trump states in the industrial Midwest, stealing a march in the South in places like North Carolina and Florida, and even competing in traditional red states like Georgia, Texas and Arizona. The Democrats are likely to pick up seats again in the House, she says, pegging the total at nine pickups in Texas alone, and have a decent chance of taking back the Senate. And in a view that goes against years of accepted political wisdom that says the choice of a running mate doesn’t much matter, the key she says, to a 2020 Democratic victory will lie less in who is at the top of the ticket than in who gets chosen as veep. A good ticket-mate would be a person of color like Stacey Abrams or Julián Castro, she suggests, someone who can further ignite Democratic partisans who might otherwise stay home. The reason Trump won in 2016 was not, she says, because of a bunch of disaffected blue-collar former Democrats in the Midwest; it is because a combination of Jill Stein, Gary Johnson and Evan McMullin pulled away more than 6 percent of voters in a state like Michigan. These were anti-Hillary voters, yes—but they were anti-Trump voters especially, and they are likely to come to the Democratic fold this time around if they’re given a reason. Bitecofer walks across the Christopher Newport University campus this January. | Julia Rendleman for Politico Magazine Trump appears to understand Bitecofer’s theories as well as anyone in politics. He leans into the divisions and negative partisanship. In 2018, Trump turned the midterms into a referendum on him, warning that Democrats would bring crime and chaos into their neighborhoods if they won. There was a turnout surge among Trump voters in some places, but it wasn’t enough to offset the Democratic gains. Bitecofer already sees the Trump playbook coming together for 2020: warning of a demographic takeover by nonwhites in order to boost turnout among noncollege white voters, and trying to sow chaos in the Democratic ranks so that supporters of a losing primary candidate either stay home or support a third-party candidate. Unlike forecasters like FiveThirtyEight’s Nate Silver, who believe that candidates seen as too ideologically extreme pay a political cost, Bitecofer doesn’t see much of a downside to a candidate like Bernie Sanders. But she doesn’t see much of an upside either, since ideology isn’t as big a motivator as identity, and since Sanders did not in fact bring hordes of new voters to the polls in 2016. (Overall turnout in the 2016 primaries was down compared with 2008, when Barack Obama led a surge in the youth vote. In 2016, Sanders just did remarkably well among the young as Clinton tanked.) There is some risk to nominating Joe Biden, who could be seen as a candidate of the status quo against a disrupter like Trump, but either way, the key will be to do their version of what Trump does to them every day: make the prospect of four more years of Republican rule seem like a threat to the Republic, one that could risk everything Democratic-leaning voters hold dear. “If you want to win the election, you have to be able to frame your candidacy in a way that reminds voters that Trump is an abnormality that must be excised,” she said. “People always say in campaigns, ‘America’s future is on the ballot.’ Well this time you will have to convince them that it really is.” CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article misidentified a state where a blue-dog Democratic senator was defeated in 2018. It was North Dakota, not South Dakota.</td>\n",

       "      <td>The most theatrical lawyer in the impeachment trial is a radio host who‘s managed to win the president’s trust. So … how about the Supreme Court? President Donald Trump's personal lawyer Jay Sekulow. | Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Darren Samuelsohn is a senior White House reporter for POLITICO. When it was finally Jay Sekulow’s time to defend Donald Trump in his Senate impeachment trial, the longtime conservative Christian legal crusader leapt out of his seat and barreled toward the podium. With his booming radio host’s voice, Sekulow posed a simple question to the senators who composed the president’s jury. “Why are we here?” he asked. For Sekulow, the question was entirely rhetorical, a dramatic opening to a diatribe against what he described as three years of overreach by Democratic zealots. But the query could have just as easily been about Sekulow himself: Why was he here? The answers are a mix of media savvy, personal loyalty and a kind of Teflon flamboyance that are becoming a familiar recipe for success in the orbit of the 45th president. Sekulow, who has hosted a radio show for 25 years, shares the president’s instinct for speaking past the D.C. gatekeepers and directly to the Trump-friendly public, reducing legal nuance to a form of us vs. them pugilism. He’s the most media-friendly operator among a group of Trump lawyers that has at times been closed off, unfamiliar or even gruff to the press. Others in the president’s circle turn to Sekulow for guidance on managing the insistent and advice-averse commander in chief. “Because the president wants him there,” said Joe diGenova, an informal Trump legal adviser and frequent defender of the president on conservative cable TV. Sekulow could offer the impeachment defense the president wanted, and diGenova explained that the relationship between Sekulow and Trump “is not to be trifled with.” “You want to keep your job? You get along with Jay,” diGenova said. During the impeachment trial, Sekulow didn’t speak the longest — that was Patrick Philbin, a top White House deputy. He wasn’t the biggest celebrity — that was Ken Starr and Alan Dershowitz. He didn’t even make the primary opening or closing arguments — that was White House counsel Pat Cipollone. But Sekulow was the defense team’s master of ceremonies and its Trump translator. As the trial unfolded, Sekulow treated the Senate chamber like it was his daily radio show, relishing the chance to defame Joe Biden to a captive public and shout at Democrats about all of Trump’s deep-state grievances. His soundbites provided a steady stream of fodder for the Twitter feeds of the White House and Trump reelection campaign. He held court during news conferences in the Capitol, escorted by White House staffers as if he were an official aide, not the president’s personal lawyer. Legal experts found Sekulow’s style off-putting; his arguments drew criticism as both nonsensical and incriminating his own client. With the trial’s outcome essentially preordained, none of it mattered in a legal sense. Anything said on the floor was more of a branding exercise, a show put on for the media and his very important, very particular boss. Pat Cipollone and Jay Sekulow. | Mark Wilson/Getty Images “I wanted to develop a theme,” Sekulow said, reflecting on impeachment in a series of exclusive interviews with POLITICO during the Senate trial. “I think it was successful. But look, history will judge that. I think it was better for all in the media. At least you knew what was coming.” And now talk has turned to what’s next for a lawyer who, by all reports, has succeeded wildly at pleasing the Audience of One. Trump’s lawyers won’t lack for work; Sekulow plans to remain the president’s legal counsel as he faces a succession of congressional and courtroom challenges throughout his 2020 reelection bid. He’s heading to the Supreme Court in a few weeks to defend Trump’s claims that so long as he’s president he can ignore both state and congressional investigations. And soon after impeachment is over Sekulow will return to defending the president in a different format, against enemies both perceived and real, on his radio show, which reaches an estimated 1.5 million conservative Christian listeners. Although Sekulow is unlikely to jump into a formal role in Trump’s administration, a Trump victory in November would open the door to all manner of new positions and additional cases, to say nothing of some rewards for his service. Sekulow juggles both legal and religious charitable enterprises — work that has recently come under scrutiny — and that will assuredly benefit from his heightened profile. His friends and allies even talk openly, with varying levels of seriousness, about Trump rewarding his 63-year-old attorney a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court. “He’s certainly qualified,” said John Dowd, a former Trump personal attorney who worked with Sekulow on special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia probe and remains close friends with his former colleague. “He’d be a terrific Supreme Court justice.” More than three years into a tenure of constant scandal and legal headaches, Sekulow has remarkably emerged as the last man standing among Trump’s always-evolving crop of lawyers. Michael Cohen, Trump’s legal fixer during the campaign, is doing three years in prison for his work on behalf of Trump. Don McGahn, Trump’s first White House counsel, became a key witness for Mueller after he witnessed the president’s attempts to shut down the Russia investigators. A series of personal and White House attorneys have come and gone, some of them pushed out, others leaving on their own terms or when Trump wouldn’t listen to their counsel: Marc Kasowitz, Michael Bowe, John Dowd, Ty Cobb and Emmet Flood. At one point in early 2018, Sekulow was actually the only attorney on Trump’s personal legal team during a brief interlude after Dowd quit and the president reversed course on a plan to hire diGenova and his wife, Victoria Toensing. Eventually, Trump added Rudy Giuliani, the former New York mayor who now faces federal scrutiny over his recent behavior while working on the president’s behalf. As for Sekulow, he has mostly remained above the fray — by Trump-era standards, that is. Trump hired Sekulow in June 2017 to help represent him in the Russia probe, at the encouragement of then-White House senior adviser Stephen Bannon, the erstwhile Breitbart chief. Sekulow had visited the White House a few weeks earlier, looking for the administration’s help to secure the release of an American pastor, Andrew Brunson, who’d been held in a Turkish prison on charges of spying and aiding terrorists. Having spent much of his career working in the Christian legal advocacy world, Sekulow didn’t have extensive experience in criminal investigations. But he did have something that Bannon knew Trump would love — chops with conservatives and doing cable TV. “I’ve been practicing law for 38 years. If the president of the United States asks you for legal advice, and if you are a lawyer and you are serving your country and the Constitution, you do it,” Sekulow told his listeners when he formally announced his new role. Of the Mueller probe, he added: “This is an attack on the presidency, that is what this is.” Jay Sekulow has a news conference during the Senate impeachment trial. | Alex Wroblewski/Getty Images From the start, Sekulow had his own mishaps. Just a few weeks into his tenure, Sekulow seemed to inadvertently admit in a Fox New interview that Trump was indeed under investigation. He also drew criticism for denying that the president had helped draft a misleading statement from his son, Donald Trump Jr., about the infamous 2016 Trump Tower meeting with a Russian attorney promising dirt on Hillary Clinton. Yet he stayed, becoming a kind of constant on the president’s rotating cast of lawyers, the one that others turned to when they were unsure how to navigate Trump’s impulses. Sekulow began to enjoy regular access to the president: meetings in the White House residence and lunches with Trump in the dining room adjacent to the Oval Office. At times during the Mueller probe, it appeared that Sekulow had almost round-the-clock access to the president. His colleagues took notice. “I’ve watched Jay and followed his lead in handling the president,” said Dowd, who worked as a Trump lawyer from June 2017 to March 2018. Ultimately, Sekulow is credited, alongside Dowd, with convincing the president to resist meeting with Mueller’s investigators for an interview, even though their client at times agitated to defend himself in person. The duo told the president he might commit perjury and should stick to written answers. “The president listens to him and Jay speaks the truth to power and the president appreciates it, even when he disagrees with him,” Dowd said. “That’s what I observed.” Sekulow argues that he wasn’t leading the strategy; he was just providing support. The attorney likens it to his role playing drums in a Christian dad-rock band—mostly religious-themed classic rock covers like the Doobie Brothers’ “Jesus Is Just Alright” and some more overtly Christian originals. “I kept the momentum. I kept the beat,” he told POLITICO. “I think that was helpful.” As Trump’s legal team prepared for the president’s Senate impeachment trial, it seemed like Sekulow might, for once, be left on the sidelines. The House had decided to advance only articles of impeachment describing Trump’s attempts to pressure Ukraine into investigating a political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden. Because Trump’s Ukraine actions were taken in his capacity as president, it was assumed that Sekulow, as a personal attorney, would defer to the official White House lawyers to mount Trump’s impeachment defense in the Senate. Then Sekulow found his way in. All it took were a few glancing references to Mueller’s work in the House Democrats’ impeachment articles and a more detailed accounting in their opening filings to the Senate ahead of the formal trial. Sekulow saw the mentions as a way in for him to mount a Senate defense that focused less on combating the Ukraine allegations and more on decrying rabid investigations that he said had improperly plagued the president since Day One. Sekulow had unique insights on that full scope, as he was the only Trump legal team member who had represented the president since the Russia probe burst into the public consciousness in the spring of 2017. Sekulow’s role was cemented after Democrats’ opening arguments. Trump lawyers thought their opponents hadn’t presented a coherent message, and the president’s personal attorney sensed he among his colleagues was best positioned when their turn came up to walk the senators through an outline of what they’d hear and who they’d be hearing from. “I was a logical person,” Sekulow said in an interview on the final day of the Senate trial. And he had a flair for the dramatic, a way of attracting attention on behalf of a boss who appreciates a bit of theater. During one of his turns at the dais, Sekulow waved a copy of the hefty Mueller report in the air as he complained that the special counsel probe had wasted $32 million to uncover no evidence of collusion between Trump’s 2016 campaign and Russia. “Your adrenaline is pretty high. Once you are in the flow of it you kind of, you go,” Sekulow recounted later. During the two-week trial, Sekulow ended up having several opportunities to address the impeachment articles from the Senate floor. There, he defended the Trump presidency through the widest possible lens, often delivering riffs that were clearly aimed not at the 100 senators in front of him, but at the president and his legions of supporters. His arguments ranged from a critique of government spying, and the original premise behind the FBI’s Russia probe, to the long-term consequences of Congress trying to remove a president over what his lawyers maintained were simple policy differences over how to deal with corruption in Ukraine. “That is more indicative of his ability to try to create the landscape that this was considered in, that it was a political event,” said Republican Sen. Richard Burr, who helms the Senate Intelligence Committee that has extensively investigated Russian meddling and government surveillance. “You wouldn’t expect the White House counsel to do that, and Sekulow had the ability to do that.” Sekulow also became the defense team’s emcee. He introduced his colleagues one by one as they took turns parsing the House-passed impeachment articles and the constitutional arguments Democrats made for the president’s removal. During the trial’s two-day question and answer session last week, Sekulow served as the self-described “defensive coordinator,” deciding who should go to the nearby lectern to address the senators. Most of the time, he just nodded across the defense table to Philbin, who ended up answering 66 questions in all, according to a C-SPAN tabulation. But Sekulow took 17 questions himself — the second most on his side, and more than anyone among the House Democratic managers besides California Rep. Adam Schiff. Democrats tried in vain to note several glaring inconsistencies in Sekulow’s rationale. One moment in particular that stood out was when Sekulow told senators that Democrats should go to the courts to try and secure witnesses. The argument seemed to willfully neglect the fact that Democrats had already sued to get testimony from a top former Trump aide, and that Trump’s own Justice Department lawyers were arguing that the issue didn’t belong in the courts. Not everyone appreciated his act. “He fits Trump's M.O., which is to be aggressive, take no prisoners,” said Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat and former state attorney general. “It’s a style that works in some cases for some clients in some settings.” Sen. Maria Cantwell, a Washington Democrat, merely noted: “He speaks very loudly.” Even a few conservatives quibbled with his handling of Trump’s defense, feeling he didn’t bring the legal heft necessary for the moment. “Impeachment trials require Daniel Webster and Trump brought My Cousin Vinny,” wrote Chris Truax, a California attorney and adviser for the nonprofit group Republicans for the Rule of Law, in a USA Today op-ed. But this is impeachment in the Trump-era. Sekulow did exactly what Trump wanted: articulate a defense strategy that kept things simple for senators and that came across well to a segment of the TV-watching public. “He's a very effective advocate for the president within the community that believes in the president, and potentially some open-minded people,” said Ari Fleischer, a former George W. Bush White House press secretary and a frequent Trump defender. On Wednesday, Sekulow got his reward — Trump’s acquittal. Even if the outcome seemed politically predictable from the start, untethered to the arguments made on either side, it still represented a capstone moment in Sekulow’s career. Just ahead of the final vote, Sekulow said he planned to react the same way he does at the end of any case: turn to his colleagues and say “next case.” Within conservative legal circles, Sekulow was a well-known figure long before he became a recurring character in seasons 1 through 4 of the Trump presidency. Like Trump, Sekulow was born in New York. Unlike Trump, he cemented his reputation fighting religious freedom cases before the Supreme Court, often from his perch at the American Center for Law &amp; Justice, the conservative Christian social-activist organization founded by the famous televangelist Pat Robertson. It’s a path that had him working alongside a lot of figures who would later feature prominently in the recent Senate impeachment trial. In 2000, Sekulow and Sen. John Cornyn, then the Texas attorney general, represented a local school district that was attempting to allow student-led prayer at high school football games. The duo lost, 6-3. In 2003, Sekulow helped represent a group of students before the Supreme Court as part of a larger case that Mitch McConnell led, seeking to have the entire McCain-Feingold campaign finance law tossed on constitutional grounds. The law largely survived but Sekulow won in challenging a provision that banned political contributions by minors. Sekulow has also argued at the Supreme Court level both against and alongside Chief Justice John Roberts, who used to appear before the court as a Justice Department official. The two were on the same side of a winning case that determined protesters at an abortion clinic in Washington, D.C., were not depriving women of their constitutional rights. It was the conservative advocacy world that brought together Sekulow and Trump. While Sekulow couldn’t recall exactly when he first met Trump, he said the introduction likely came through social circles the two shared with Robertson, who has been hosting his Christian talk show, “The 700 Club,” for decades. One of the earliest documented interactions between Sekulow and Trump was in August 2011, when Trump called in to Sekulow’s daily radio show for a 10-minute interview that veered from a critique of President Barack Obama’s economic policies to the musings of a perennial political candidate who sounded torn over whether he should be running for the White House. “I was leading the polls when I decided to do another season of ‘Apprentice,’” Trump bragged about the decision he’d made a few months earlier not to seek the GOP nomination, even as he teased a third-party run. “If the Republicans choose the wrong person I would seriously consider running as an independent,” Trump said, a veiled reference to one of the party’s frontrunners at the time, Mitt Romney. Sekulow was flattering during the talk, introducing Trump as “somebody that knows a lot about the economy.” Trump returned the compliments: “I hear you have a fantastic show and it’s really an honor doing this show.” President Donald Trump was acquitted by the Senate of the two articles of impeachment Wednesday. | Leah Millis-Pool/Getty Images It was a dynamic that would come to define their relationship. Sekulow, a minor figure outside conservative Christian circles, got the mainstream attention the self-promoting Trump could bring to any subject. Trump, a former pro-abortion rights Democrat and indifferent voter starring at the time in his own prime-time reality TV show, got the Christian conservative seal of approval he needed to make forays into Republican politics. The same give-and-take was apparent in April 2015. Trump took to Twitter to extol a “must read” Fox News op-ed from Sekulow detailing his push for Obama’s help in negotiating the release of an American pastor, Saeed Abedini, who had been held at that time for 2½ years in an Iranian prison. “He amplified things.” Sekulow recalled, noting that Trump had been drawing attention to his work on behalf of Abedini’s plight on social media since 2013. Now, Trump has amplified Sekulow himself. The lawyer is a tad evasive about how he plans to use his new platform when his moment in the Trump spotlight ends, though. “Sleep,” he joked. In the coming days, Sekulow will still have Trump legal battles to fight. Next month, he’ll go before the Supreme Court to argue that Trump’s financial records should be shielded from both state and congressional investigators. It’ll be his 13th career appearance before the justices, and a win could define presidential powers not just for Trump but for any future chief executive. And with impeachment over, Sekulow plans to go back to his radio show full-time after doctors remove a polyp on his vocal chord, an issue he was putting off until after the Senate trial. In the long run, it’s unclear exactly how Sekulow might cash in on his newfound prominence. His work for Trump carries the prospect of considerable financial benefits — if not imminently, then down the road. For his work with Trump, it appears Sekulow has been paid by the Republican National Committee through the Constitutional Litigation &amp; Advocacy Group, a for-profit corporation that Sekulow co-owns. The Associated Press recently reported that the company lacked a website and was not listed in national legal directories. Its only physical footprint seems to be a rented mailbox near the White House. According to RNC campaign expenditures, the Constitutional Litigation &amp; Advocacy Group has been paid more than $250,000 since 2017. The documents show a one-time payment of $131,250 in the 2018 cycle, and then two $60,000 disbursements made in October and November of 2019. A couple days into the Senate trial, reporters pressed Sekulow about his financial arrangement with the president. “I wouldn’t say ‘paid adviser,’” he replied during a news conference in the Capitol, with a White House deputy spokesman looking on. “I’m the president’s retained counsel. I don’t discuss my legal fees. But we’re paid for our legal services.” Asked again about it, Sekulow raised his voice and snapped, “I’m not getting into it.” If Trump wins a second term, Sekulow could likely take a more formal White House role. Or he could keep fighting the inevitable legal battles that will trail Trump for four more years, especially if Democrats retain control of the House. But friends and associates predict that Sekulow will want to continue his legal advocacy work, now with the added benefit of being famous — by legal standards, of course. He’s always been a bit of a freelancer, working in many different arenas and from many different locations. “Jay is like the wind. You just don’t know where he is. But he’s wherever he needs to be,” Cobb said in an interview in early 2018, when he was a White House attorney regularly in touch with Sekulow as a member of Trump’s outside legal team. “Sometimes I’m in Nashville, sometimes in Washington, Atlanta,” Sekulow said in an interview around the same time. Burr, the North Carolina Republican, said on the final day of the impeachment trial that Sekulow would make out just fine after the president’s acquittal. “I think Jay's clients in the past have always rewarded him financially, and I think that seems to have fulfilled his lifetime ambitions,” Burr said. Then, of course, there’s the vocal contingent pushing for Supreme Court Associate Justice Jay Sekulow. It’s a long shot, at best, given he has no official judicial experience and controversial financial arrangements. At 63, he’s also more than a decade older than the typical appointee. “For me, Jay belongs on the Supreme Court,” said diGenova. “I’ve always said that about him, and now it’s even more clear.” Louisiana Rep. Mike Johnson, one of eight House Republicans tapped by the White House as surrogates during the impeachment trial, said Sekulow would be a “compelling choice” for a future opening on the nation’s highest court. “There are few people that have his level of experience and, you know, understanding of big issues facing the country,” he said. “That's intriguing.” Sekulow, presented with the concept at the most prominent moment of his legal career, merely laughed. “Way too old,” he replied. “Not even in the cards at all.”</td>\n",

Someone, anyway, got access to the Times Editorial Board computers and turned out this parody editorial on Obamacare: Congressional Republicans have stoked consumer fears and confusion with charges that the health care reform law is causing insurers to cancel existing policies and will force many people to pay substantially higher premiums next year for coverage they don’t want. That, they say, violates President Obama’s pledge that if you like the insurance you have, you can keep it. Mr. Obama clearly misspoke when he said that. HaHaHaHaHa! President Obama misspoke 27 times! And curiously enough, when he misspoke it was the centerpiece of his argument for his supposedly signature legislative achievement! Even the Times editorial board wouldn’t try to sell that one; it’s got to be the Onion. By law, insurers cannot continue to sell policies that don’t provide the minimum benefits and consumer protections required as of next year. So they’ve sent cancellation notices to hundreds of thousands of people who hold these substandard policies. Sure! From now on you can pay extra for pediatric dental coverage, even if you don’t have any kids! , but the 10 million to 12 million people who buy policies directly on the individual market. Here the Onion goes too far. It can’t expect us to believe that the Times editorial board is so ill-informed that it doesn’t realize we are talking about employer-sponsored group plans. As we wrote here, the Obama administration itself calculated, back in 2010, that more than one-half of all employer-sponsored plans will be dropped once Obamacare goes into effect. And that is just in the short term; in the long run, the Obama administration acknowledged that all current plans will be phased out and those covered by them will have to pay more, in some cases with help from the taxpayers or Chinese banks. Still, every good parody goes over the top at some point. Well done, Onion!   \n",

foundational set of lies.  They are the centerpiece of our Lies of Obamacare series of posts, most recently featuring John’s important contribution.  Today Kyle Smith devotes a New York Post column to the lie that has consumed our attention over the past week or two.  Smith’s column puts an exclamation point on the exposure of Obama’s calculated deceit:  On June 15, 2009, Obama said, in one of hundreds of similar statements, “No matter how we reform health care, we will keep this promise to the American people: If you like your doctor, you will be able to keep your doctor, period. If you like your health-care plan, you’ll be able to keep your health-care plan, period. No one will take it away, no matter what.” This wasn’t just bulls – – t. This was a lie.  Smith column concludes:  There is no escape. What Obama said wasn’t true and that’s all there is to it. To the American public, he is a different man than he was last week. People can handle bulls – – t, but not dishonesty. We don’t like that. His approval rating touched an all-time low this week in the NBC/WSJ poll, and that was before his deception became the news of the week. Obama has rebranded himself as a liar, forever. He will carry this new label to his grave.  Whole thing here.   \n",

The political results were predictably dreary; both Mark Dayton and Al Franken are favored for re-election, in part because hardly anyone has heard of any of their prospective GOP opponents. But for some reason, PPP also asked some sports questions, and they found an interesting split with regard to the Minnesota Vikings’ current quarterback controversy. Let’s back up. Two years ago, the Vikings were awful, finishing 3-13. Last year, they surprised everyone by going 10-6 and making the post-season, with Christian Ponder, who played well down the stretch, at the helm. This year the team is off to a poor start, currently 1-6. Ponder started the season at QB; Matt Cassel, a career back-up, has started one game–the only one the Vikings have won so far–and the team signed Josh Freeman when Freeman was cut by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Freeman has started one game, just days after he joined the team. He clearly was not in command of the offense, and looked awful. He also suffered a mild concussion in that game, which put Ponder back in the starting role. So here in Minnesota, we have a quarterback controversy, which is another way of saying we don’t have a very good quarterback. They don’t have quarterback controversies in New England or Denver. With that background, here are PPP’s findings: Ponder is the top QB choice among Republicans, with 34 percent of those polled, while Democrats prefer Josh Freeman, who got 30 percent of those polled. Let’s acknowledge up front that we are dealing at the margin of statistical significance. That said, the question is intriguing: why would Republicans tend to favor Ponder, and Democrats Freeman? Christian Ponder There is one obvious, stereotypical explanation: Republicans favor the guy who has had some success and is a known commodity. Democrats prefer to throw a hail-Mary on a guy who has only played one game, did a pretty horrible job, but has a strong arm and maybe some yet-unseen up-side. That could be the explanation. Josh Freeman But I suspect that something else is going on. It is striking, if you live here in Minnesota and especially if you read comments on stories in the Minneapolis Star Tribune sports pages, how some people hate Christian Ponder. They don’t just think he isn’t a very good quarterback; they don’t merely think he doesn’t have a very good arm. They hate him. Literally. Why? The only analogy I can think of is the way many liberals hate Tim Tebow. As it happens, Christian Ponder is a mini-Tebow. His parents weren’t kidding when they named him. As you might know, he married ESPN football reporter Samantha Steele last year. In this interview, he described Samantha as “a true woman of God.” Those are not, to be honest, the words that occurred to me when I first saw Ms. Steele. There are a number of other religious references in that interview, and most others Ponder has done. Samantha Ponder Is that why some–not all, by any means, but some–Democrats hate Ponder? I suspect that it is. Many liberals, maybe most, are actively anti-religious. They are engaged in a campaign to drive any positive references to religion out of the public sphere. A man like Christian Ponder, in that context, is beyond the pale. They hate him. I would like to be wrong, but I suspect that is what explains the partisan division in Minnesota’s quarterback controversy. For what it is worth, I am not a big pro football fan, but I will be rooting for Ponder and the Vikings tomorrow against the Dallas Cowboys.   \n",

                                                   Lawmakers from both parties have sown doubt that this year’s vote will be free and fair. Here’s how to fix it. By EDWARD B. FOLEY Edward B. Foley directs the Election Law program at the Ohio State University’s Moritz College of Law, where he also holds the Ebersold Chair in constitutional law. President Donald Trump’s impeachment awakened debates about political corruption, foreign aid, executive privilege, the meaning of the Constitution and more. But what the country just went through was fundamentally about something else, as well: the integrity of our elections. Both Republicans and Democrats said their positions on impeachment were intended to protect the 2020 election. Yet, as it ends, the process looks like it could have the opposite effect. American election integrity is at serious risk, not so much because of the outcome of the trial, but because of the way the two sides argued their cases. After resisting calls for Trump’s impeachment for months, fearing the process would be seen as an effort to undo the 2016 election, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi changed her mind because Trump’s Ukraine call was about the next election; Democrats felt they needed to stop Trump from gaining an unfair advantage in 2020 by attempting to enlist a foreign country’s help. Yet, when impeachment moved to the Senate, the House managers argued that unless Trump was removed from office, the 2020 election couldn’t, as Representative Adam Schiff put it, be “assured” of being “fairly won.” This argument suggests that as long as an acquitted Trump is on the ballot in November, there is a risk the election will be unfair, and that its results cannot be trusted as the genuine choice of the American electorate—a recipe for chaos. Republicans, too, said their position on impeachment was meant to protect election integrity, by making sure voters have the opportunity to reelect Trump to a second term if that their electorate’s preference. Yet, many Republicans in Congress joined Trump in claiming that the president had done nothing wrong in trying to recruit Ukraine to undermine Joe Biden as a 2020 electoral opponent. To suggest that an incumbent president can do whatever he wants to win reelection, as long as it is not a crime, is an intolerable position from the perspective of protecting America’s free and fair elections. In other words: Republicans (with a few notable exceptions) have condoned a form of cheating in the presidential race, while the Democratic impeachment managers claim that Trump, even if he makes no further attempts to cheat, already has lost any chance to be a legitimate winner. If both parties genuinely thought they were protecting the electoral process, they have been proved wrong: The prospect of holding an honest election has never seemed so fragile, at least not in modern times. Is there anything we can do about it now? It won’t be easy, especially after the searing experience of the impeachment trial, but if both parties are serious about election integrity, it’s possible to salvage this post-impeachment moment and America’s election process. There is no better time than the aftermath of an intense fight for political leaders to act, and there are a number of practical steps they could take before November. To start, enough Republicans should join Democrats on some sort of official Senate resolution asserting that there need to be limits to presidential mischief in a reelection campaign. While it seems unlikely at this point that the Senate will formally censure Trump over his Ukraine-related misconduct, surely there are at least four GOP votes for a measure that, without mentioning Trump or Ukraine, categorically rejects the “anything goes” argument heading forward. Acquitting the president in order to protect his place on the ballot was one thing, but now that that’s been accomplished for the sake of the party, a few GOP senators for the sake of the country should go on record saying that, for this and future elections, incumbent presidents running for reelection must not seek or allow improper election interference. This sort of Senate resolution could say something as specific as: “It shall henceforth be a high misdemeanor, punishable upon impeachment by removal from office and future disqualification from the same, for a first-term president to exercise powers of the presidency to interfere with the choice of American voters to decide whether or not to reelect the president.” A reasonable debate might be had in the Senate over whether such impeachable behavior should be limited to presidential decisions that directly interfere with voters’ right to cast their ballots—as would be the case, for example, if an incumbent president perniciously ordered federal immigration agents to patrol polling places on Election Day hoping to disenfranchise eligible voters. Alternatively, the impeachable behavior could extend to obtaining assistance, from foreign governments or other recipients of federal funds (like state and local governments), to undermine a potential rival candidate through intentionally deceptive messaging. Either approach, albeit to differing degrees, would put the president on notice that, his acquittal over the Ukraine matter aside, there is presidential misbehavior that the Senate cannot condone. One free pass is not a permanent “get out of jail free” card. While Trump undoubtedly would speak out against any such proclamation, considering it an implicit rebuke to him, it is precisely because he would resist it that the Senate should show some firmness. Deterring Trump from committing misconduct would not be the only, or even the main, purpose of a Senate resolution. It would be a statement of principle from the legislative branch, and if Trump were to violate that principle, it would be a test of whether the Senate would abide by the standard it set for itself. Senators currently can justify their acquittal of Trump on the ground that the “law” of impeachment was murky before the Ukraine matter arose. But once this resolution is on the books, the issue is murky no more. For all of this to mean anything, Democrats also must extend an olive branch: some sort of magnanimous retraction of their position, expressed by House managers, that the 2020 election inherently would lack legitimacy with Trump on the ballot. Think of it as the equivalent of a losing candidate’s concession speech at the end of a hard-fought campaign. Trump won. The Democrats lost, and so they must concede Trump’s ongoing legitimacy as president. Beyond this, the Democrats should acknowledge that if Trump engages in no further “cheating,” then he can win the election fair and square, in which case the Democrats will accept the victory as valid. (This concession speech would come, most meaningfully, from Pelosi, but that seems less likely after her reaction to Trump’s State of the Union speech. It would still be meaningful coming from Schiff as the lead House manager.) Beyond such efforts at reconciliation, there are additional bipartisan steps Congress could take to put election integrity on firmer footing. Recall that a minimal degree of bipartisan cooperation is necessary to complete any presidential election; the House and Senate must come together for a special joint session to count the electoral votes from the states and declare the winner. In order to shore up voters’ confidence that this year’s election will be conducted fairly, Congress, as well as organizations of state-level election officials, between now and November should expressly recognize the necessity for bipartisanship in the administration of the election. Furthermore, given the current political atmosphere, it is highly likely that partisans on one side or the other—or both simultaneously—will challenge the legitimacy of the electoral process as it unfolds this fall. “Rigged,” someone will shout, or tweet. “Cheating,” someone else will say, echoing the language of impeachment. The initial reactions to the technological failures in this week’s Iowa caucuses—namely, observers who jumped to the conclusion that the results themselves were compromised, even though there was no evidence of that—is an early warning sign that America needs help in navigating what’s correct and incorrect about the process of counting votes. If and when there are charges of voter suppression or miscounted ballots this fall, it would be good to have in place a bipartisan body, even if only advisory in nature, to assess whether the charges are founded and merit formal investigation, while helping to diffuse confusion and controversy. Ideally, the panel would be established by Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Alternatively, any two Senators from opposite sides of the aisle could step up (how about Lamar Alexander and Tim Kaine?), or ex-presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, given the advisory nature of the enterprise. Even short of creating this kind of advisory body, Congress would do well to hold hearings on the kind of challenges the electoral process might face in the fall. Although there have been hearings about cybersecurity and foreign interference, less attention has been paid to the basic concept of conducting a free and fair election in a hyperpolarized environment. Some resulting, narrowly targeted statutory fixes would be especially valuable. For example, Congress could clarify that the existing prohibition on the deployment of federal military troops at polling places applies to other “armed” federal personnel as well, even if they are Homeland Security, rather that Defense Department, troops. Despite all the pitfalls that this impeachment now poses for a successful 2020 election, the vote in November still can be successful—meaning it accords with the will of the American electorate, whichever candidate wins, and is accepted by both sides as legitimate. But just as failure is not inevitable (despite what some Democrats might say), success also is not guaranteed. And the impeachment process, in the immediate aftermath of Trump’s acquittal, makes success more difficult and uncertain.

We knew how this would end. We asked historians and impeachment experts how it will all look in 50 years. The monthslong impeachment process that ended Wednesday could feel like a blur of news and political theater all leading up to a foregone conclusion. Donald Trump is still the president. Americans’ confidence in the whole political process, whatever their party, is still dented. So what did we all just live through? Throughout the impeachment proceedings, POLITICO Magazine convened a panel of experts on the rare and dramatic event called impeachment. In response to the acquittal vote, we asked them to look into the future and offer one more insight: How will the history books look back on this moment? What was it all for—the rhetoric, the ceremony, the investigations, the defense, the taxpayer money? We asked them to spice their expertise with some imagination and write a paragraph from the history books of 2070, the one describing the impeachment process’ lasting effects on American government and politics. Depending on which universe we end up with in 2070, the impeachment will have accelerated the political rise of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, “ushered in the age of the imperial presidency,” or “sounded the death knell of impeachment as a bulwark against an outlaw president,” according to the experts.

The Trump era began with Trump’s election in 2016, hit a high point with his acquittal on impeachment in 2020 and ended with President Mike Pompeo’s 2028 loss to the young Midwestern Governor Tom Wilkinson. In many ways, the Trump era was a period of stasis: Few major alterations were made to the economy, which grew at a modest rate, and the foreign policy of this period amounted to muddling through with no broad vision. The “Trump era” might just as well be called the era of disunity among Democrats. Their drive to impeach President Donald Trump in 2020 not only failed in a practical sense but also overestimated the degree of popular support behind the party, which depended on the defection of Trump supporters for victory—and such victories proved elusive. In the 2020 presidential election, memories of impeachment left the Democrats isolated, and Trump’s reelection—this time with former Secretary of State Pompeo as his running mate—threw them into disarray, their leadership hobbled by intraparty blame. A second impeachment attempt, after the Trump administration was persuasively implicated in voting irregularities in the 2022 midterm elections, also resulted in failure, boosting Pompeo’s political fortunes. After his election in 2024, President Pompeo, regarded by most as lacking the charisma of his predecessor, struggled to command the attention and the affection of Trump’s supporters, who missed the style and the personality of the 45th president. Many of those supporters stayed at home on Election Day in 2024 and 2028. In 2028, enough stayed home to cost Pompeo the election. Upon his election in 2028, President Wilkerson was able to change gears on domestic political matters, but he was the first president who had to contend with the costly foreign-policy drift of the previous 12 years. He was the first president who could not ignore the rise of India, the obvious focal point of 21st-century geopolitics.

In 2020, when the House Democratic majority brought the impeachment case against Trump to the Senate, it was a consensus view among triumphant Republicans that acquittal meant impeachment had failed. Many Democrats also had doubts. Had the process been too narrowly focused on Trump’s attempt to promote an investigation into a 2020 political rival? Should the process have been slower—and should it have followed leads embedded in the 2019 Mueller report into Russian election interference? Did the timing of the impeachment and subsequent trial, which pulled three leading Democratic presidential candidates off the campaign trail, skew the primary process to privilege moderate candidates like former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg and former New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg? But was impeachment a failure? Today, the consensus among historians is mostly no. No impeached American president had ever been removed from office at the time of the 2020 impeachment, yet this did not keep Congress from playing its constitutional role at the time. And at a moment in U.S. history when constitutional checks and balances were most vulnerable to presidential overreach, Democrats in Congress—however imperfectly—signaled their determination to play their role to check and balance the executive branch.

The House of Representatives, increasingly disgusted with his policies on immigration and other matters and his crude political style, impeached Trump in 2019. The House acted, knowing that conviction was unlikely in the Republican-majority Senate. Trump, who had been elected by the Electoral College but did not win the popular vote, displayed commitment to his base and his campaign promises, no matter how problematic, and made little effort to seduce his opposition or to broaden his support. The Senate deliberations over the House’s charges gave Democrats a brief respite from their Republican colleagues’ almost daily votes confirming more judges to the federal courts for life. After Trump’s acquittal, he seemed unchastened by the impeachment episode and was easily reelected as his trade deals and low unemployment kept the economy in good shape. Thereafter, most objections to successive presidents remained in the realm of disputes over policy and how opponents could win in the next election. As for most of our history, impeachment lie dormant, still available but mostly ignored. Alan Baron is former special impeachment counsel to the U.S. House of Representatives. The impeachment and subsequent acquittal by the Senate of Trump in 2020 sounded the death knell of impeachment as a bulwark against an outlaw president. Impeachment has always been a blend of legal and political process. In Trump’s case, the political considerations obliterated the legal and constitutional framework. Trump was charged in two articles of impeachment. The first alleged he abused his power when he ordered the withholding of critical military assistance from an embattled ally, Ukraine, unless the president of that country announced an investigation into a political rival, Joe Biden. The second article alleged he obstructed Congress by blocking the production of witnesses and documents sought by the House as part of its investigation. As a result of the president’s action, no witnesses and no documents were produced at his trial. This action precluded the testimony of former national security adviser John Bolton, who, it was reported just days before the conclusion of the trial, had written in a book draft that he was told by Trump that aid to Ukraine would be withheld unless it announced an investigation into the Bidens. This decision by the Republican majority in the Senate not to call witnesses and, indeed, not to impeach Trump and remove him from office, bore bitter fruit in the long run. The case demonstrated that impeachment was not an effective means to remove a chief executive for even the most egregious misconduct by a president in the nation’s history. While most attention was focused on Article One, acquittal on the second article proved even more pernicious in the long run, obliterating the investigative function of Congress. As a result, after Trump came the age of the imperial presidency. David Blight is Sterling Professor of History, of African American studies and of American studies at Yale University. The impeachment and acquittal of Trump in 2020 left the country’s political culture in spiraling decline. For the portion of the country’s politically engaged population that was not securely within the Fox News universe, the Trump acquittal demonstrated the sheer cravenness of the Republican Party. Republicans continued to be seen in the 2020s as the party of white people, of a white nationalist, of a xenophobic vision of America that flew in the face of reality: an increasingly multiethnic, multiracial, multireligious nation. The Democratic Party also frayed into divisions between left and right. Democrats managed to defeat Trump in 2020, decisively in the popular vote but only narrowly in the Electoral College—vulnerable to charges even then that it was an archaic institution. After his defeat in 2020, Trump cut a lucrative deal with Fox News and appeared on the channel three nights per week in prime time, stoking a racist, nationalist vision of the country, while the country divided and fragmented into increasingly identity-based groups. The United States also continued to decline as a world power, losing influence in international organizations and in global economics. American institutions and corporations went into decline, and the country lost its place in the world as a model republic. Trumpism had become the watchword for American decline. By the end of the 2020s, more voters than ever identified as independent. Attempts to establish third parties surged. In 2027, a movement for a new constitutional convention succeeded. The resulting constitutional amendments to eliminate the Electoral College and to reorganize the U.S. Senate into a more democratic institution just barely failed to pass in three quarters of state legislatures for approval. Allan J. Lichtman is a history professor and author of The Case for Impeachment. The evolving defense of their client by Trump’s lawyers threatened the foundation of the democratic republic. First, his lawyers said that Trump had done nothing wrong. Second, they argued that abuse of power is not impeachable. The defense ended by asserting that the president could do anything he wants (short of an indictable crime) to assure his election. “Every public official that I know believes that his election is in the public interest,” said the president’s handpicked constitutional expert, Alan Dershowitz, on the Senate floor. “If a president does something which he believes will help him get elected in the public interest, that cannot be the kind of quid pro quo that results in impeachment.” This doctrine, which Dershowitz failed to corroborate with any judicial or scholarly authority, turned America into a sham democracy. It represented what the founders feared most about a rogue president and why they advisedly put impeachment into the Constitution. Influential framer Gouverneur Morris said, “The Executive ought therefore to be impeachable for treachery and corrupting his electors.” James Madison warned that a president might “betray his trust to foreign powers.” With Trump’s acquittal, without hearing from a single witness or the White House producing a single document, it became precedent for every president to corrupt our elections, as long as they avoided violating the criminal code. The acquittal enabled one president to use his legal declassification prerogative to give our nuclear secrets to Russia and China as a quid pro quo for their help in his reelection. It enabled another to order his Department of Justice to investigate his political opponents, including journalists and members of Congress. A president has “constitutional authority to tell the Justice Department who to investigate, who not to investigate,” Dershowitz said in a 2017 interview. This impeachment process began with Russian President Vladimir Putin’s interference in the 2016 election that Trump welcomed and exploited. It ended with a doctrine that would turn America into an autocracy. Brooks Simpson is a history professor at Arizona State University. Trump’s acquittal came as no surprise, but its long-term impact proved counterintuitive. The claims made by the president and his defenders that there were virtually no restraints on presidential power so long as the president could claim a public purpose became a mantra among his successors, while the bitter partisanship that had characterized the impeachment process reached new extremes, effectively paralyzing the policy process in perpetual stalemate. No one could argue that the Trump presidency was a momentary aberration: The logic of the president’s defenders presaged an executive unleashed as well as unhinged. Faced with a crisis of political legitimacy, political leaders from both parties moved quickly to reverse course. They labored to construct new constraints on executive power and revamped the cumbersome impeachment process. The result was a major restructuring of Article II of the Constitution that fashioned explicit restraints on presidential power in an effort to reestablish the effective use of checks and balances, as well as a restructuring of the Electoral College that forever ended the “winner-take-all” practice in favor of the proportional awarding of votes. This promoted the emergence of new parties that challenged Republican-Democratic hegemony and encouraged coalition building to secure majority approval of legislation. American politics would never be the same: It had entered a new era, a transformation attributable to Trump’s acquittal.

The acquittal of Trump marked the end of the Republican Party—a party that had stood for a strong union, rule of law and a firm foreign policy since its founding a century and a half earlier. Trump’s crimes violated each of these values, but the elected officials in the party rallied to defend him nonetheless. Although public opinion was split on the wisdom of removing the president through impeachment, three-quarters of Americans thought the trial should include witnesses, suggesting that most of those thought the impeachment trial was unfair. Defined now by a criminal president, the Republican Party became a legacy institution with rapidly diminishing support among every growing demographic of citizens in the United States. A new party of free market, socially moderate, “good government” conservatives, known as the National Union Party, quickly emerged to supplant the Republican Party in the largest states, and then the nation as a whole. The acquittal of Trump was the fatal conviction of the Republican Party.

I fear that this impeachment could mark the end of the separation of powers and a legitimate democratic republic in America. The stakes could not be higher. When Trump lawyer Alan Dershowitz admitted that Trump’s team endorsed kinglike powers—where a president’s view of what is best for him personally is per se good for America and thus beyond congressional and judicial reproach—I felt a sigh of relief that the truth was finally on the table. When Dershowitz—who is not a constitutional scholar, but a criminal law professor and defense lawyer—validated that view, Senate Republicans could have felt some relief too; finally they had political cover from an academic for voting to greenlight unlimited presidential power. I fear we will look back in 50 years and see a deterioration of individual rights as a result of this presidency: people investigated and prosecuted for defying the party in power, attacks on and silencing of the press, additional manipulation of foreign governments to entrench power in the White House, and maybe worse. People still naively say, “Never in America.“ But the framers knew that, without real checks and balances, human nature won’t self-regulate to protect against abuses of power. With this impeachment, those checks on the presidency are all but gone. Possibly for good.   \n",

President Donald Trump delivers the State of the Union. | Leah Millis-Pool/Getty Images By JOHN F. HARRIS Altitude is a column by POLITICO founding editor John Harris, offering weekly perspective on politics in a moment of radical disruption. President Donald Trump is acquitted, but the consensus view—shared by nearly all Democrats and even a decent number of Republicans—is that the United States Senate did nothing to acquit itself. Wednesday’s vote—anticipated with near-perfect precision since the opening hours of the Ukraine scandal in September—has yielded a new indictment: The partisan divisions that saved Trump are an expression of deeper and malignant trends that are a threat to constitutional democracy. By all means count me in for mournful sermons about the poor civic hygiene of America in the Age of Trump. The patient is indeed sick. But it is not because the pulse of democracy is growing faint. To the contrary, the fundamental problem of modern political culture is the erosion of accountability. Politicians have shown repeatedly the ability to escape consequences by reframing almost any controversy away from the particulars of misbehavior to the familiar question: Which side are you on, mine or my enemies'? In this dynamic, democracy—or at least the rancid brand of it we have been practicing lately—is as much culprit as victim. In the Trump-Ukraine matter, both the partisan House vote to impeach and the partisan Senate vote to acquit were, in broad terms, a faithful reflection of popular will. It is the nature of popular will—bitterly cleaved, indifferent to facts except as they can be employed as weapon or shield—that is the challenge. We can add to this another defining trait of contemporary culture: shredded attention spans. On this score, the news media and their audience—certainly myself and most likely you—share culpability with craven politicians. For now, let’s examine what we are indignant about today. My colleague Myah Ward crunched some numbers on the Senate vote. The 48 senators who voted to convict (lone Republican Mitt Romney plus all Democrats and independents Bernie Sanders and Angus King) represent states with 171.4 million Americans. The 52 Republicans who voted to acquit represent states with 156 million Americans. (For the 10 states whose senators voted different directions, Ward allocated half of the state’s population to each side.) That’s a difference of 15.2 million people, less than 5 percent of the total population. Senators voting to convict won their most recent elections with a total of 69.4 million votes, compared to 48.1 million for their main opponents. Senators voting to acquit won 57.7 million votes in their most recent elections, compared to about 45 million for their main opponents. I’m drawing no grand analytical conclusions from Ward’s math, merely observing that they seem roughly to approximate recent polls on how Americans approached the Senate trial. In recent years, progressives have grown increasingly impatient with the constitutional features designed to buffer majoritarianism and protect the interests of states, even when those interests are at odds with popular sentiment nationally. Liberal frustration is understandable. The past two Republican presidents won first terms while losing the popular vote. The intentional dilution of pure democracy in the Senate—Wyoming’s 600,000 people get two senators, as do California’s 40 million—is growing starker each year. David Birdsell, dean of the school of public and international affairs at Baruch College in New York, has done research projecting that in 20 years, 70 percent of Americans will live in the 15 largest states, meaning that 30 percent of Americans will be represented by 70 senators. His findings were publicized by the Wall Street Journal’s Gerald Seib. These structural distortions may well be a long-term problem for constitutional democracy. But there isn’t much in the impeachment ordeal that advances this argument in the short term. A POLITICO/Morning Consult poll last week found 50 percent approval for removing Trump from office and 43 percent disapproval. A composite of polls by FiveThirtyEight found that 84 percent of Democrats, 42 percent of independents and 9 percent of Republicans wanted Trump removed from office. This averaged out just under 48 percent of all Americans—by coincidence, the very number of senators voting to remove. So failure to reflect democracy’s will isn’t the problem. In fact, Romney, not used to being extolled by Democrats, took his vote to convict in apparent defiance of the Utah Republicans who sent him to the Senate. In doing so, and in his brutal words about Trump’s conduct in attempting to use military aid as leverage to induce Ukraine to investigate the Biden family, Romney was doing something rare: saying what he honestly thought based on his own notions of right and wrong, rather than calculating his words around political consequences. (This was also rare for Romney, who in the past has flipped his views on core issues like abortion rights and making health insurance mandatory based on political imperatives.) Romney, in his floor speech, said his fellow Republicans were casting different votes in good faith. That’s a generous appraisal. It is impossible to believe that Senate Republicans would think it would be fine if a President Hillary Clinton had linked military aid to her domestic political needs or even that they would be disturbed by this but think impeachment is excessive. The question is imponderable. But one paradox of the past 30 years is that the various legal and political instruments to investigate, expose, and punish misbehavior of people in power have not made it harder to get away with questionable behavior. They have made it easier. President Bill Clinton was investigated for years over obscure business dealings in the Whitewater affair that took place a decade before he came to power. His decision to replace the White House travel office was a controversy that echoed for his first term. The fundraising that allowed foreign money to seep into his reelection coffers was not merely unseemly; House Speaker Newt Gingrich called it “the opening phase of what will turn out to be the largest scandal in American history.” Twenty years later, it is worth recalling the matters that have only briefly dented headlines during the Trump years, or in some cases barely dented them at all. Recall that Trump is the first president in the modern era to not release his taxes, and he is facing inquiries over his inaugural committee’s overseas contributions and its contracts at his hotels and his personal foundation’s unfulfilled pledges of donations to worthy causes. He has seen the criminal convictions of his campaign manager, his first national security adviser and his personal lawyer. He has confronted allegations of self-dealing or misuse of taxpayer funds among officials at his health department, EPA, and Transportation Department, among others. These and other matters briefly cause an uproar, or not, then fade from consciousness of the opposition party, of the news media, of the public. This inability to give sustained focus on ethical matters that an earlier generation would have commanded national attention for months or years is not a structural challenge of the Constitution. Nor it is a thwarting of democracy. It is the expression of a democracy that has allowed its muscles of accountability to atrophy.   \n",
       "                  1009592  Rachel Bitecofer’s radical new theory predicted the midterms spot-on. So who’s going to win 2020? David Freedlander writes about politics and culture. He lives in New York. To the political scientist Rachel Bitecofer, all of that is almost certainly true, and that has made her one of the most intriguing new figures in political forecasting this year. Bitecofer, a 42-year-old professor at Christopher Newport University in the Hampton Roads area of Virginia, was little known in the extremely online, extremely male-dominated world of political forecasting until November 2018. That’s when she nailed almost to the number the nature and size of the Democrats’ win in the House, even as other forecasters went wobbly in the race’s final days. Not only that, but she put out her forecast back in July, and then stuck by it while polling shifted throughout the summer and fall. And today her model tells her the Democrats are a near lock for the presidency in 2020, and are likely to gain House seats and have a decent shot at retaking the Senate. If she’s right, we are now in a post-economy, post-incumbency, post record-while-in-office era of politics. Her analysis, as Bitecofer puts it with characteristic immodesty, amounts to nothing less than “flipping giant paradigms of electoral theory upside down.” Her analysis, as Bitecofer puts it with characteristic immodesty, amounts to nothing less than “flipping giant paradigms of electoral theory upside down.” Bitecofer’s theory, when you boil it down, is that modern American elections are rarely shaped by voters changing their minds, but rather by shifts in who decides to vote in the first place. To her critics, she’s an extreme apostle of the old saw that “turnout explains everything,” taking a long victory lap after getting lucky one time. She sees things slightly differently: That the last few elections show that American politics really has changed, and other experts have been slow to process what it means. If she’s right, it wouldn’t just blow up the conventional wisdom; it would mean that much of the lucrative cottage industry of political experts—the consultants and pollsters and (ahem) the reporters—is superfluous, an army of bit players with little influence over the outcome. Actually, worse than superfluous: That whole industry of experts is generally wrong. The classic view is that the pool of American voters is basically fixed: About 55 percent of eligible voters are likely to go to the polls, and the winner is determined by the 15 percent or so of “swing voters” who flit between the parties. So a general election campaign amounts to a long effort to pull those voters in to your side. Bitecofer has a nickname for this view. She calls it, with disdain, the “Chuck Todd theory of American politics”: “The idea that there is this informed, engaged American population that is watching these political events and watching their elected leaders and assessing their behavior and making a judgment.” “And it is just not true.” A few of the newly elected members of the House take a selfie outside the Capitol during their week in Washington last November for orientation meetings. | Win McNamee/Getty Images Election forecasting has existed at least as long as there have been elections. In the 15th century, there were betting odds on who would emerge the winner of the next papal conclave. By the end of the 19th century, newspapers were asking readers to cut out makeshift ballots and mail them to the newsroom in order to get a preview of the election outcome. In recent years polling has grown more sophisticated, as has poll analysis: Pity the poor rube these days who cites a mere poll instead of a “polling average.” Alongside the enthusiasm for polls has grown a serious academic interest in predicting elections. Unlike polling, academic forecasters tend to use the state of the world on Election Day to determine who is going to win. An improving GDP? It means an X-point advantage for the incumbent. Two (or more) terms in power for a single party, and that’s an electoral drag. In 2016, the pollsters had the race largely wrong, but the academic forecasters got it mostly right, even though many ended up doubting their formulas after they spat out a likely victory for Trump, since such an outcome seemed impossible. But even the more academic forecasts, like the polling models, are based on longstanding assumptions about why and how candidates win elections. And sometimes an event occurs that blows up those assumptions. In Bitecofer’s experience, that event wasn’t Trump; it was the Tea Party. She was still a graduate student in 2010 when a wave of conservative populism returned the Republicans to power in the House. According to any conventional theory of politics, that wave made no sense. Two years prior the GOP had run the economy into the ground; under a Democratic president and a fully Democratic Congress, the economy had stopped its slide and begun to recover. How could the Democrats lose 63 seats in a brutal shellacking two years after totally routing the Republicans? The prevailing analysis was that Democrats had overreached on policy: After Obamacare, the stimulus, the bank and auto bailouts, the center just revolted. But when Americans picked a president in 2012, they didn’t seem so appalled; Obama won again. The 2014 midterms confounded the polls; the generic ballot heading into Election Day had the two parties basically tied in the national generic ballot, but when the votes came in, the Republicans added seats to their House majority and routed the Democrats in the Senate, picking up nine seats. For most election forecasters, these results meant more data, and they went back and tweaked their models. For Bitecofer, at the beginning of her career, they became the foundation of her thinking. She was something of an outsider from the start; she had grown up a Navy brat, mostly in the D.C. area, and spent her youth following the Grateful Dead and Widespread Panic, reading The New York Times in the parking lot between shows. She was living in Eugene, Oregon, a single mom at a dead-end administrative job at a Republican polling firm, when she heard Rachel Maddow on Air America mention her doctorate in political science. “I was like, ‘Wait, you can study politics?’” she says. She enrolled in community college, then the University of Oregon, then on to the University of Georgia for a Ph.D., and was soon hired by Christopher Newport University to work in its public-policy division. (She has since been hired away by the Niskanen Center, a centrist think tank based in Washington, D.C., while maintaining her academic post.) Rachel Bitecofer has a decorative nameplate on her desk at Christopher Newport University. | Julia Rendleman for Politico Magazine In 2016, the election that truly embarrassed the experts, Bitecofer was teaching in her new job and didn’t put together a forecast. She doesn’t pretend she saw it coming: She says she was as surprised Trump won as anyone else, but what struck her in examining the results, and what she saw as getting lost in the postelection commentary, was exactly how many people voted third party—for the Greens, the Libertarians or Evan McMullin, a former CIA operative who was running on behalf of the “Never Trump” wing of the Republican Party. Hillary Clinton had run an entire campaign built around classic assumptions: She was trying to pick off Republicans and Republican-leaning independents appalled by Trump. So she chose a bland white man, Tim Kaine, as a running mate; it also explained her policy-lite messaging and her ads. But in the end, almost all of those voters stuck with the GOP. The voters who voted third party should have been Democratic voters—they were disproportionately young, diverse and college educated—but they were turned off by the divisive Democratic primary, and the Clinton camp made no effort to activate them in the general election. As she delved further into the data on 2016, Bitecofer noticed something else. As much as the media had harped on the narrative that a majority of white women had voted for Trump, the election also signaled the first time that a majority of college-educated white men had voted for the Democratic Party. There was a long-term-realignment happening in America, and 2016 had accelerated it. Part of Bitecofer’s job involved polling Virginia, and she saw a Democratic counterwave building there in 2017. She noted to Democrats in the state that they should spend resources in areas that had traditionally been off limits. Had they done so, Bitecofer says, they could have flipped the Legislature that year. (Instead it flipped in 2019.) When 2018 rolled around, she saw what was coming: “College educated white men, and especially college educated white women,” she said, “were going to be on fucking fire.” It didn’t matter who was running; it mattered who was voting. From there, the model followed. She put out her forecast for the general election when there were still candidates battling it out in primaries. Bitecofer’s view of the electorate is driven, in part, by a new way to think about why Americans vote the way they do. She counts as an intellectual mentor Alan Abramowitz, a professor of political science at Emory University who popularized the concept of “negative partisanship,” the idea that voters are more motivated to defeat the other side than by any particular policy goals. In a piece explaining his work in POLITICO Magazine, Abramowitz wrote: “Over the past few decades, American politics has become like a bitter sports rivalry, in which the parties hang together mainly out of sheer hatred of the other team, rather than a shared sense of purpose. Republicans might not love the president, but they absolutely loathe his Democratic adversaries. And it’s also true of Democrats, who might be consumed by their internal feuds over foreign policy and the proper role of government were it not for Trump.” Bitecofer took this insight and mapped it across the country. As she sees it, it isn’t quite right to refer to a Democratic or Republican “base.” Rather, there are Democratic and Republican coalitions, the first made of people of color, college-educated whites and people in metropolitan areas; the second, mostly noncollege whites, with a smattering of religious-minded voters, financiers and people in business, largely in rural and exurban counties. “In the polarized era, the outcome isn’t really about the candidates. What matters is what percentage of the electorate is Republican and Republican leaners, and what percentage is Democratic and Democratic leaners, and how they get activated,” she said. Accordingly, she believed that whom the Democrats nominated didn’t matter much, and while the rest of the country focused on the districts where Hillary Clinton defeated Trump, she thought those were already mostly in the bag, and so focused instead on the 20 or so districts where Trump performed worse than Mitt Romney had in 2012. Those were places with latent Democratic possibility, and had the national party recognized it earlier, they could have flipped even more seats. Since she was new on the forecasting scene, having sat out the 2016 election, Bitecofer took to Twitter, where she had a mere 600-odd followers, and started flogging her analysis relentlessly. “I decided I’d market it on Twitter by being kind of like this clunky annoying little sister on all the big threads. I would jump on Nate Cohn and Nate Silver threads to promote the forecast. And it was just when the generic ballot was starting to narrow and all the other analysts were saying, ‘Oh the Democrats are going to screw this up. They are overreaching. They are going to get 23 seats if they are lucky.’ And I just came out swinging.” “She has taken a Krassenstein Brothers approach at getting attention for her forecasts. In my view that is unfair to the many thoughtful forecasters who don’t relentlessly self-promote.” And while other forecasters picked a range, Bitecofer picked a number—42, only one more than the actual number of seats Democrats ended up winning in the House. (As other forecasters saw the Democrats’ chances dropping, she revised it upward in the race’s waning days, saying in the final week that the Democrats would net 45 seats.) The forecast, and the relentless Twitter-hyping, brought her recognition. The woman who decided to get a degree in political science because she heard Rachel Maddow on the radio was suddenly on Rachel Maddow’s network. In the MSNBC Green Room before a guest appearance on “The Last Word with Lawrence O’Donnell,” she wrote on the chalkboard: “Rachel’s Bucket List: Make it to MSNBC Green Room.” Bitecofer’s approach to getting noticed did not endear her to many people in the insular world of elections forecasting, where a certain modesty and an ethos of letting the work speak for itself prevails. “She has taken a Krassenstein Brothers approach at getting attention for her forecasts,” says the election forecaster Dave Wasserman, House editor of the Cook Political Report, referring to the pair of anti-Trump bros who gained over a million Twitter followers between them, mostly by being some of the first people to reply to Trump tweets and by stirring up #Resistance memes. “In my view that is unfair to the many thoughtful forecasters who don’t relentlessly self-promote.” He questions her central idea—that elections are won by turnout, and by people entering and exiting the electorate rather than by switching sides—as one that simply ignores many basic observations about how politics works. “The idea that turnout explains every election result, I am sorry, but that is just factually not true,” said Wasserman. “There are a significant number of persuadable voters who bounce back and forth between the two parties depending on the candidates and depending on the year. And there are absolutely millions of voters who voted for Donald Trump in 2016 and for a Democratic congressional candidate in 2018 and did so because they were persuaded by Democratic campaign outreach. “She would be well-served as an analyst,” Wasserman added, “if she visited some of the counties in Iowa which voted overwhelmingly for Obama and then overwhelmingly for Trump. These are not places where turnout explains the results. She would learn that persuasion and swing voters are the dominant variable in presidential elections, particularly in those battleground states.” Bitecofer, as it happens, flew to Iowa for three days before and after the caucuses, a few weeks after I spoke to Wasserman—and rejects the criticism that somehow getting out in the world would improve her modeling. If she allowed personal conversations to influence her work, she said, then “I would be a god-fucking awful quantitative scientist.” As for the overall role of those voters, she maintains that actual swing voters are a small percentage of the result, even in counties where the vote swing is as large as Wasserman describes. Don’t talk to people in the bleachers of rallies; check the voter file, she says. “It would be one thing if that county had 100,000 people in it who voted in 2012, and then it was the same 100,000 who voted in 2016, but that is not what is happening,” she says. “The pool of who shows up changes.” Signs in Boone County, Iowa, for Obama and Trump in 2012 and 2016, respectively.

The Democrats are in a fractious primary at the moment. Knowing who would fare better against Donald Trump would be useful, but Bitecofer’s models don’t say. Election forecasting that uses sociological data is a blunt instrument in a nation where 138 million people vote across 50 states scattered across a continent, each with its own way of administering the process. “It’s the big discussion in election forecasting and political science right now,” said Kyle Kondik, communications director at the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics and an editor at its forecasting site, Sabato’s Crystal Ball. “As I look at it, there are just a lot of different things going on in the electorate. There are a lot of folks who switched from Obama 2012 to Trump 2016. I think that’s pretty clear, but there also were turnout problems for Democrats in these places, and you had people switching or defecting to third parties. The more you learn about this stuff, the less you feel like you have a grasp on it.” Sam Wang, a neuroscientist at Princeton University who since 2004 has doubled as an elections forecaster, and who famously ate a cricket on live television to make up for his erroneous 2016 forecast declaring Clinton the all-but certain winner, agrees. The percentage of people who swing in and out of the electorate is closer to 10 percent, according to his data, which couldn’t explain the massive swings some counties saw from 2012 to 2016. As for Bitecofer’s overall theory, Wang says, “It is the detailed version of something that is generally appreciated—that over the last 20 years the big phenomenon in American politics is that Americans have become much more predictable about who they vote for,” he said. “The broad insight is the deep truth of our time, but it is not that novel.” Bitecofer hasn’t exactly been clairvoyant: Her original Senate prediction was off in 2018. She didn’t anticipate the surge in GOP turnout that would match the surge in Democratic turnout in places where the demographics still favored Republicans. She thought Democrats would win Florida, and maybe even Texas, and that the Georgia governor’s race was winnable. What she didn’t count on at the time was that negative partisanship can work both ways, even when there is one party in power, and that no one knows how to fire up the fear factor in his coalition quite like Donald Trump. He did just that, and Blue Dog Democrats in Missouri and Indiana and North Dakota were done for. But still, the results bore out her theory: For Democrats to win, they need to fire up Democratic-minded voters. The Blue Dogs who tried to narrow the difference between themselves and Trump did worse, overall, than the Stacey Abramses and Beto O’Rourkes, whose progressive ideas and inspirational campaigns drove turnout in their own parties and brought them to the cusp of victory. If you buy Bitecofer’s view of the 2018 midterms—or even, in its milder form, Sam Wang’s point about predictability—you also need to rethink what American elections actually mean now. “I am arguing radical shit, OK?” Bitecofer told me over a series of phone calls over the past several weeks in her Virginia office. “What I am saying is that almost all of this shit is set in stone for three years, that almost none of the shit that people are hanging onto, in terms of daily articles, or polls, or the economy or incumbency or ideology is really worth that much.” When Democrats swept into power in the House of Representatives in the 2018 midterms, they did so, they told themselves, because they mostly ignored Donald Trump. Believing that they needed to win over “Obama/Trump voters,” the Democrats ran a bunch of apolitical military veterans, and focused their campaigns on preserving the Affordable Care Act’s protections of people with preexisting health conditions. Armed with this mandate, they governed accordingly, passing laws (all of which died in the Senate, of course) to lower the price of prescription drugs, raise the minimum wage and curb the power of money in politics. “The broad insight is the deep truth of our time, but it is not that novel.” But the electorate that elected Donald Trump in 2016 and the electorate that gave Democrats control of the House in 2018 might as well have been from two different countries, Bitecofer says. The first was whiter, had less college education and lived in more rural parts of the country than the second, which was more diverse, better educated and more urban than its counterpart from two years prior. That change had nothing to do with Democrats luring swing voters with savvy messaging, and everything to do with a bunch of people, who were appalled by the president, showing up at the polls, wanting to make their feelings known. Once you know the shape of the electorate, she argues, you can pretty much tell how that electorate is going to vote. And the shape of the electorate in 2018, and 2020, for that matter, was determined on the night of November 8, 2016. The new electorate, as she forecasts it, is made up mostly of people who want a president named anything but Donald Trump, competing with another group that fears ruin should anyone but Donald Trump be president. The first group, the Democratic universe of voters, now includes some very strange bedfellows, everyone from former Bush speechwriter David Frum to Susan Sarandon. It includes Al Sharpton and also the chief strategists for both Mitt Romney and John McCain’s failed presidential bids. It is Americans who are college-educated, who are not white or who live in or near a major urban center. This group turned out in force in the 2018 midterms, much the same way Tea Party voters showed up in 2010 to express their unhappiness at Obama. The more candidates talked about Trump and what a threat he was to their way of life, the more partisans were activated. Although the ranks of independents are growing, up to 40 percent by some surveys, Bitecofer says campaigns have spent entirely too much time courting them, and the media has spent entirely too much caring about their preferences. The real “swing” doesn’t come from voters who choose between two parties, she argues, but from people who choose to vote, or not (or, if they do vote, vote for a third party). The actual percentage of swing voters in any given national election according to her own analysis is closer to 6 or 7 percent than the 15 or 20 most analysts think are out there, and that larger group, Bitecofer says, are “closet partisans” who don’t identify with a party but still vote with one. (The remaining 6 percent or so of true independents, she says, tend to vote for whoever promises a break with the status quo.) “If you think of independents as a fixed pool of voters that change preferences,” she says, “well, that has implications for how you campaign after them. But if you are talking about the preference of independents changing because the pool of independents changes, well that is a different fucking banana.” In 2012, Bitecofer points out, Obama actually lost independents while winning the election, and in Ohio, he lost them by 10 points, but still carried the crucial swing state. There are just simply more Democrats in much of the country, and if they are activated by a belief that, say, the Republican presidential nominee is a heartless plutocrat who thinks 47 percent of the population can be written off as grifters and that corporations are people, and the Democrat gets just a handful of those true independents, then it becomes impossible for Republicans to win. Bitecofer has already released her 2020 model, and is alone among election forecasters in giving the Democrats—who, of course, do not yet have a nominee—the 270 electoral votes required to claim the presidency without a single toss-up state flipping their way. She sees anyone in the top tier, or even the second tier of candidates, as strong enough to win back most of the Trump states in the industrial Midwest, stealing a march in the South in places like North Carolina and Florida, and even competing in traditional red states like Georgia, Texas and Arizona. The Democrats are likely to pick up seats again in the House, she says, pegging the total at nine pickups in Texas alone, and have a decent chance of taking back the Senate. And in a view that goes against years of accepted political wisdom that says the choice of a running mate doesn’t much matter, the key she says, to a 2020 Democratic victory will lie less in who is at the top of the ticket than in who gets chosen as veep. A good ticket-mate would be a person of color like Stacey Abrams or Julián Castro, she suggests, someone who can further ignite Democratic partisans who might otherwise stay home. The reason Trump won in 2016 was not, she says, because of a bunch of disaffected blue-collar former Democrats in the Midwest; it is because a combination of Jill Stein, Gary Johnson and Evan McMullin pulled away more than 6 percent of voters in a state like Michigan. These were anti-Hillary voters, yes—but they were anti-Trump voters especially, and they are likely to come to the Democratic fold this time around if they’re given a reason. Bitecofer walks across the Christopher Newport University campus this January. | Julia Rendleman for Politico Magazine Trump appears to understand Bitecofer’s theories as well as anyone in politics. He leans into the divisions and negative partisanship. In 2018, Trump turned the midterms into a referendum on him, warning that Democrats would bring crime and chaos into their neighborhoods if they won. There was a turnout surge among Trump voters in some places, but it wasn’t enough to offset the Democratic gains. Bitecofer already sees the Trump playbook coming together for 2020: warning of a demographic takeover by nonwhites in order to boost turnout among noncollege white voters, and trying to sow chaos in the Democratic ranks so that supporters of a losing primary candidate either stay home or support a third-party candidate. Unlike forecasters like FiveThirtyEight’s Nate Silver, who believe that candidates seen as too ideologically extreme pay a political cost, Bitecofer doesn’t see much of a downside to a candidate like Bernie Sanders. But she doesn’t see much of an upside either, since ideology isn’t as big a motivator as identity, and since Sanders did not in fact bring hordes of new voters to the polls in 2016. (Overall turnout in the 2016 primaries was down compared with 2008, when Barack Obama led a surge in the youth vote. In 2016, Sanders just did remarkably well among the young as Clinton tanked.) There is some risk to nominating Joe Biden, who could be seen as a candidate of the status quo against a disrupter like Trump, but either way, the key will be to do their version of what Trump does to them every day: make the prospect of four more years of Republican rule seem like a threat to the Republic, one that could risk everything Democratic-leaning voters hold dear. “If you want to win the election, you have to be able to frame your candidacy in a way that reminds voters that Trump is an abnormality that must be excised,” she said. “People always say in campaigns, ‘America’s future is on the ballot.’ Well this time you will have to convince them that it really is.” CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article misidentified a state where a blue-dog Democratic senator was defeated in 2018. It was North Dakota, not South Dakota.   \n",

So … how about the Supreme Court? President Donald Trump's personal lawyer Jay Sekulow. | Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Darren Samuelsohn is a senior White House reporter for POLITICO. When it was finally Jay Sekulow’s time to defend Donald Trump in his Senate impeachment trial, the longtime conservative Christian legal crusader leapt out of his seat and barreled toward the podium. With his booming radio host’s voice, Sekulow posed a simple question to the senators who composed the president’s jury. “Why are we here?” he asked. For Sekulow, the question was entirely rhetorical, a dramatic opening to a diatribe against what he described as three years of overreach by Democratic zealots. But the query could have just as easily been about Sekulow himself: Why was he here? The answers are a mix of media savvy, personal loyalty and a kind of Teflon flamboyance that are becoming a familiar recipe for success in the orbit of the 45th president. Sekulow, who has hosted a radio show for 25 years, shares the president’s instinct for speaking past the D.C. gatekeepers and directly to the Trump-friendly public, reducing legal nuance to a form of us vs. them pugilism. He’s the most media-friendly operator among a group of Trump lawyers that has at times been closed off, unfamiliar or even gruff to the press. Others in the president’s circle turn to Sekulow for guidance on managing the insistent and advice-averse commander in chief. “Because the president wants him there,” said Joe diGenova, an informal Trump legal adviser and frequent defender of the president on conservative cable TV. Sekulow could offer the impeachment defense the president wanted, and diGenova explained that the relationship between Sekulow and Trump “is not to be trifled with.” “You want to keep your job? You get along with Jay,” diGenova said. During the impeachment trial, Sekulow didn’t speak the longest — that was Patrick Philbin, a top White House deputy. He wasn’t the biggest celebrity — that was Ken Starr and Alan Dershowitz. He didn’t even make the primary opening or closing arguments — that was White House counsel Pat Cipollone. But Sekulow was the defense team’s master of ceremonies and its Trump translator. As the trial unfolded, Sekulow treated the Senate chamber like it was his daily radio show, relishing the chance to defame Joe Biden to a captive public and shout at Democrats about all of Trump’s deep-state grievances. His soundbites provided a steady stream of fodder for the Twitter feeds of the White House and Trump reelection campaign. He held court during news conferences in the Capitol, escorted by White House staffers as if he were an official aide, not the president’s personal lawyer. Legal experts found Sekulow’s style off-putting; his arguments drew criticism as both nonsensical and incriminating his own client. With the trial’s outcome essentially preordained, none of it mattered in a legal sense. Anything said on the floor was more of a branding exercise, a show put on for the media and his very important, very particular boss. Pat Cipollone and Jay Sekulow. | Mark Wilson/Getty Images “I wanted to develop a theme,” Sekulow said, reflecting on impeachment in a series of exclusive interviews with POLITICO during the Senate trial. “I think it was successful. But look, history will judge that. I think it was better for all in the media. At least you knew what was coming.” And now talk has turned to what’s next for a lawyer who, by all reports, has succeeded wildly at pleasing the Audience of One. Trump’s lawyers won’t lack for work; Sekulow plans to remain the president’s legal counsel as he faces a succession of congressional and courtroom challenges throughout his 2020 reelection bid. He’s heading to the Supreme Court in a few weeks to defend Trump’s claims that so long as he’s president he can ignore both state and congressional investigations. And soon after impeachment is over Sekulow will return to defending the president in a different format, against enemies both perceived and real, on his radio show, which reaches an estimated 1.5 million conservative Christian listeners. Although Sekulow is unlikely to jump into a formal role in Trump’s administration, a Trump victory in November would open the door to all manner of new positions and additional cases, to say nothing of some rewards for his service. Sekulow juggles both legal and religious charitable enterprises — work that has recently come under scrutiny — and that will assuredly benefit from his heightened profile. His friends and allies even talk openly, with varying levels of seriousness, about Trump rewarding his 63-year-old attorney a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court. “He’s certainly qualified,” said John Dowd, a former Trump personal attorney who worked with Sekulow on special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia probe and remains close friends with his former colleague. “He’d be a terrific Supreme Court justice.” More than three years into a tenure of constant scandal and legal headaches, Sekulow has remarkably emerged as the last man standing among Trump’s always-evolving crop of lawyers. Michael Cohen, Trump’s legal fixer during the campaign, is doing three years in prison for his work on behalf of Trump. Don McGahn, Trump’s first White House counsel, became a key witness for Mueller after he witnessed the president’s attempts to shut down the Russia investigators. A series of personal and White House attorneys have come and gone, some of them pushed out, others leaving on their own terms or when Trump wouldn’t listen to their counsel: Marc Kasowitz, Michael Bowe, John Dowd, Ty Cobb and Emmet Flood. At one point in early 2018, Sekulow was actually the only attorney on Trump’s personal legal team during a brief interlude after Dowd quit and the president reversed course on a plan to hire diGenova and his wife, Victoria Toensing. Eventually, Trump added Rudy Giuliani, the former New York mayor who now faces federal scrutiny over his recent behavior while working on the president’s behalf. As for Sekulow, he has mostly remained above the fray — by Trump-era standards, that is. Trump hired Sekulow in June 2017 to help represent him in the Russia probe, at the encouragement of then-White House senior adviser Stephen Bannon, the erstwhile Breitbart chief. Sekulow had visited the White House a few weeks earlier, looking for the administration’s help to secure the release of an American pastor, Andrew Brunson, who’d been held in a Turkish prison on charges of spying and aiding terrorists. Having spent much of his career working in the Christian legal advocacy world, Sekulow didn’t have extensive experience in criminal investigations. But he did have something that Bannon knew Trump would love — chops with conservatives and doing cable TV. “I’ve been practicing law for 38 years. If the president of the United States asks you for legal advice, and if you are a lawyer and you are serving your country and the Constitution, you do it,” Sekulow told his listeners when he formally announced his new role. Of the Mueller probe, he added: “This is an attack on the presidency, that is what this is.” Jay Sekulow has a news conference during the Senate impeachment trial. | Alex Wroblewski/Getty Images From the start, Sekulow had his own mishaps. Just a few weeks into his tenure, Sekulow seemed to inadvertently admit in a Fox New interview that Trump was indeed under investigation. He also drew criticism for denying that the president had helped draft a misleading statement from his son, Donald Trump Jr., about the infamous 2016 Trump Tower meeting with a Russian attorney promising dirt on Hillary Clinton. Yet he stayed, becoming a kind of constant on the president’s rotating cast of lawyers, the one that others turned to when they were unsure how to navigate Trump’s impulses. Sekulow began to enjoy regular access to the president: meetings in the White House residence and lunches with Trump in the dining room adjacent to the Oval Office. At times during the Mueller probe, it appeared that Sekulow had almost round-the-clock access to the president. His colleagues took notice. “I’ve watched Jay and followed his lead in handling the president,” said Dowd, who worked as a Trump lawyer from June 2017 to March 2018. Ultimately, Sekulow is credited, alongside Dowd, with convincing the president to resist meeting with Mueller’s investigators for an interview, even though their client at times agitated to defend himself in person. The duo told the president he might commit perjury and should stick to written answers. “The president listens to him and Jay speaks the truth to power and the president appreciates it, even when he disagrees with him,” Dowd said. “That’s what I observed.” Sekulow argues that he wasn’t leading the strategy; he was just providing support. The attorney likens it to his role playing drums in a Christian dad-rock band—mostly religious-themed classic rock covers like the Doobie Brothers’ “Jesus Is Just Alright” and some more overtly Christian originals. “I kept the momentum. I kept the beat,” he told POLITICO. “I think that was helpful.” As Trump’s legal team prepared for the president’s Senate impeachment trial, it seemed like Sekulow might, for once, be left on the sidelines. The House had decided to advance only articles of impeachment describing Trump’s attempts to pressure Ukraine into investigating a political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden. Because Trump’s Ukraine actions were taken in his capacity as president, it was assumed that Sekulow, as a personal attorney, would defer to the official White House lawyers to mount Trump’s impeachment defense in the Senate. Then Sekulow found his way in. All it took were a few glancing references to Mueller’s work in the House Democrats’ impeachment articles and a more detailed accounting in their opening filings to the Senate ahead of the formal trial. Sekulow saw the mentions as a way in for him to mount a Senate defense that focused less on combating the Ukraine allegations and more on decrying rabid investigations that he said had improperly plagued the president since Day One. Sekulow had unique insights on that full scope, as he was the only Trump legal team member who had represented the president since the Russia probe burst into the public consciousness in the spring of 2017. Sekulow’s role was cemented after Democrats’ opening arguments. Trump lawyers thought their opponents hadn’t presented a coherent message, and the president’s personal attorney sensed he among his colleagues was best positioned when their turn came up to walk the senators through an outline of what they’d hear and who they’d be hearing from. “I was a logical person,” Sekulow said in an interview on the final day of the Senate trial. And he had a flair for the dramatic, a way of attracting attention on behalf of a boss who appreciates a bit of theater. During one of his turns at the dais, Sekulow waved a copy of the hefty Mueller report in the air as he complained that the special counsel probe had wasted $32 million to uncover no evidence of collusion between Trump’s 2016 campaign and Russia. “Your adrenaline is pretty high. Once you are in the flow of it you kind of, you go,” Sekulow recounted later. During the two-week trial, Sekulow ended up having several opportunities to address the impeachment articles from the Senate floor. There, he defended the Trump presidency through the widest possible lens, often delivering riffs that were clearly aimed not at the 100 senators in front of him, but at the president and his legions of supporters. His arguments ranged from a critique of government spying, and the original premise behind the FBI’s Russia probe, to the long-term consequences of Congress trying to remove a president over what his lawyers maintained were simple policy differences over how to deal with corruption in Ukraine. “That is more indicative of his ability to try to create the landscape that this was considered in, that it was a political event,” said Republican Sen. Richard Burr, who helms the Senate Intelligence Committee that has extensively investigated Russian meddling and government surveillance. “You wouldn’t expect the White House counsel to do that, and Sekulow had the ability to do that.” Sekulow also became the defense team’s emcee. He introduced his colleagues one by one as they took turns parsing the House-passed impeachment articles and the constitutional arguments Democrats made for the president’s removal. During the trial’s two-day question and answer session last week, Sekulow served as the self-described “defensive coordinator,” deciding who should go to the nearby lectern to address the senators. Most of the time, he just nodded across the defense table to Philbin, who ended up answering 66 questions in all, according to a C-SPAN tabulation. But Sekulow took 17 questions himself — the second most on his side, and more than anyone among the House Democratic managers besides California Rep. Adam Schiff. Democrats tried in vain to note several glaring inconsistencies in Sekulow’s rationale. One moment in particular that stood out was when Sekulow told senators that Democrats should go to the courts to try and secure witnesses. The argument seemed to willfully neglect the fact that Democrats had already sued to get testimony from a top former Trump aide, and that Trump’s own Justice Department lawyers were arguing that the issue didn’t belong in the courts. Not everyone appreciated his act. “He fits Trump's M.O., which is to be aggressive, take no prisoners,” said Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat and former state attorney general. “It’s a style that works in some cases for some clients in some settings.” Sen. Maria Cantwell, a Washington Democrat, merely noted: “He speaks very loudly.” Even a few conservatives quibbled with his handling of Trump’s defense, feeling he didn’t bring the legal heft necessary for the moment. “Impeachment trials require Daniel Webster and Trump brought My Cousin Vinny,” wrote Chris Truax, a California attorney and adviser for the nonprofit group Republicans for the Rule of Law, in a USA Today op-ed. But this is impeachment in the Trump-era. Sekulow did exactly what Trump wanted: articulate a defense strategy that kept things simple for senators and that came across well to a segment of the TV-watching public. “He's a very effective advocate for the president within the community that believes in the president, and potentially some open-minded people,” said Ari Fleischer, a former George W. Bush White House press secretary and a frequent Trump defender. On Wednesday, Sekulow got his reward — Trump’s acquittal. Even if the outcome seemed politically predictable from the start, untethered to the arguments made on either side, it still represented a capstone moment in Sekulow’s career. Just ahead of the final vote, Sekulow said he planned to react the same way he does at the end of any case: turn to his colleagues and say “next case.” Within conservative legal circles, Sekulow was a well-known figure long before he became a recurring character in seasons 1 through 4 of the Trump presidency. Like Trump, Sekulow was born in New York. Unlike Trump, he cemented his reputation fighting religious freedom cases before the Supreme Court, often from his perch at the American Center for Law & Justice, the conservative Christian social-activist organization founded by the famous televangelist Pat Robertson. It’s a path that had him working alongside a lot of figures who would later feature prominently in the recent Senate impeachment trial. In 2000, Sekulow and Sen. John Cornyn, then the Texas attorney general, represented a local school district that was attempting to allow student-led prayer at high school football games. The duo lost, 6-3. In 2003, Sekulow helped represent a group of students before the Supreme Court as part of a larger case that Mitch McConnell led, seeking to have the entire McCain-Feingold campaign finance law tossed on constitutional grounds. The law largely survived but Sekulow won in challenging a provision that banned political contributions by minors. Sekulow has also argued at the Supreme Court level both against and alongside Chief Justice John Roberts, who used to appear before the court as a Justice Department official. The two were on the same side of a winning case that determined protesters at an abortion clinic in Washington, D.C., were not depriving women of their constitutional rights. It was the conservative advocacy world that brought together Sekulow and Trump. While Sekulow couldn’t recall exactly when he first met Trump, he said the introduction likely came through social circles the two shared with Robertson, who has been hosting his Christian talk show, “The 700 Club,” for decades. One of the earliest documented interactions between Sekulow and Trump was in August 2011, when Trump called in to Sekulow’s daily radio show for a 10-minute interview that veered from a critique of President Barack Obama’s economic policies to the musings of a perennial political candidate who sounded torn over whether he should be running for the White House. “I was leading the polls when I decided to do another season of ‘Apprentice,’” Trump bragged about the decision he’d made a few months earlier not to seek the GOP nomination, even as he teased a third-party run. “If the Republicans choose the wrong person I would seriously consider running as an independent,” Trump said, a veiled reference to one of the party’s frontrunners at the time, Mitt Romney. Sekulow was flattering during the talk, introducing Trump as “somebody that knows a lot about the economy.” Trump returned the compliments: “I hear you have a fantastic show and it’s really an honor doing this show.” President Donald Trump was acquitted by the Senate of the two articles of impeachment Wednesday. | Leah Millis-Pool/Getty Images It was a dynamic that would come to define their relationship. Sekulow, a minor figure outside conservative Christian circles, got the mainstream attention the self-promoting Trump could bring to any subject. Trump, a former pro-abortion rights Democrat and indifferent voter starring at the time in his own prime-time reality TV show, got the Christian conservative seal of approval he needed to make forays into Republican politics. The same give-and-take was apparent in April 2015. Trump took to Twitter to extol a “must read” Fox News op-ed from Sekulow detailing his push for Obama’s help in negotiating the release of an American pastor, Saeed Abedini, who had been held at that time for 2½ years in an Iranian prison. “He amplified things.” Sekulow recalled, noting that Trump had been drawing attention to his work on behalf of Abedini’s plight on social media since 2013. Now, Trump has amplified Sekulow himself. The lawyer is a tad evasive about how he plans to use his new platform when his moment in the Trump spotlight ends, though. “Sleep,” he joked. In the coming days, Sekulow will still have Trump legal battles to fight. Next month, he’ll go before the Supreme Court to argue that Trump’s financial records should be shielded from both state and congressional investigators. It’ll be his 13th career appearance before the justices, and a win could define presidential powers not just for Trump but for any future chief executive. And with impeachment over, Sekulow plans to go back to his radio show full-time after doctors remove a polyp on his vocal chord, an issue he was putting off until after the Senate trial. In the long run, it’s unclear exactly how Sekulow might cash in on his newfound prominence. His work for Trump carries the prospect of considerable financial benefits — if not imminently, then down the road. For his work with Trump, it appears Sekulow has been paid by the Republican National Committee through the Constitutional Litigation & Advocacy Group, a for-profit corporation that Sekulow co-owns. The Associated Press recently reported that the company lacked a website and was not listed in national legal directories. Its only physical footprint seems to be a rented mailbox near the White House. According to RNC campaign expenditures, the Constitutional Litigation & Advocacy Group has been paid more than $250,000 since 2017. The documents show a one-time payment of $131,250 in the 2018 cycle, and then two $60,000 disbursements made in October and November of 2019. A couple days into the Senate trial, reporters pressed Sekulow about his financial arrangement with the president. “I wouldn’t say ‘paid adviser,’” he replied during a news conference in the Capitol, with a White House deputy spokesman looking on. “I’m the president’s retained counsel. I don’t discuss my legal fees. But we’re paid for our legal services.” Asked again about it, Sekulow raised his voice and snapped, “I’m not getting into it.” If Trump wins a second term, Sekulow could likely take a more formal White House role. Or he could keep fighting the inevitable legal battles that will trail Trump for four more years, especially if Democrats retain control of the House. But friends and associates predict that Sekulow will want to continue his legal advocacy work, now with the added benefit of being famous — by legal standards, of course. He’s always been a bit of a freelancer, working in many different arenas and from many different locations. “Jay is like the wind. You just don’t know where he is. But he’s wherever he needs to be,” Cobb said in an interview in early 2018, when he was a White House attorney regularly in touch with Sekulow as a member of Trump’s outside legal team. “Sometimes I’m in Nashville, sometimes in Washington, Atlanta,” Sekulow said in an interview around the same time. Burr, the North Carolina Republican, said on the final day of the impeachment trial that Sekulow would make out just fine after the president’s acquittal. “I think Jay's clients in the past have always rewarded him financially, and I think that seems to have fulfilled his lifetime ambitions,” Burr said. Then, of course, there’s the vocal contingent pushing for Supreme Court Associate Justice Jay Sekulow. It’s a long shot, at best, given he has no official judicial experience and controversial financial arrangements. At 63, he’s also more than a decade older than the typical appointee. “For me, Jay belongs on the Supreme Court,” said diGenova. “I’ve always said that about him, and now it’s even more clear.” Louisiana Rep. Mike Johnson, one of eight House Republicans tapped by the White House as surrogates during the impeachment trial, said Sekulow would be a “compelling choice” for a future opening on the nation’s highest court. “There are few people that have his level of experience and, you know, understanding of big issues facing the country,” he said. “That's intriguing.” Sekulow, presented with the concept at the most prominent moment of his legal career, merely laughed. “Way too old,” he replied. “Not even in the cards at all.”   \n",
