       "'I\\'m working my way through Charles Krauthammer\\'s Things That Matter, a collection of his columns over the past three decades. The book\\'s publication has provided the occasion for some much-deserved appreciation of the man, whose personal story is remarkable and whose influence on politics is unique. (In what now seems like ancient history, he suggested a plan for averting a debt ceiling crisis in early 2013, which worked.) Still, it feels as though few reviewers have identified what, exactly, makes Krauthammer special. It\\'s not just his remarkable recovery from a disabling accident, which Chris Wallace discussed on Fox News Sunday. He does not define the conservative agenda the way Rush Limbaugh or Mark Levin sometimes do. While he\\'s no David Brooks, telling the media what they want to hear, he sometimes dissents from the conservative line. What Krauthammer does, above all, is translate\\xa0conservatism into the conventional language of mainstream political debate. Conservatives tune in to see him on Fox News Special Report\\xa0or e-mail his weekly column around because we like the way he puts our case to the world--not necessarily because he puts it best. (The result still manages to shock some liberals, as clips of his appearances on DC-area\\xa0Inside Washington\\xa0show.) On the Jon Stewart show, Krauthammer praised Social Security and Medicare as the \"achievements\" of liberal politics, and praised the \"success\" of the welfare state. He also backed away from a full-throated defense of Ted Cruz (though he did not throw Cruz under the bus). Those gestures struck many conservatives, including me, as rather surprising. But tactically, they were effective: Stewart sat and listened, as did his audience. Krauthammer\\'s columns have a patient but plaintive style, as if he is addressing a skeptical audience, never quite losing faith that they will listen to reason. He is the guest at the dinner party who says something quite unexpected. There is a gasp or two. Forks clatter onto plates. And then he starts to explain, and his hosts start to listen. He challenges them, never \"singing for his supper.\" But he still manages to secure another invite. The task of explaining conservatism is one that Krauthammer takes very seriously. It is telling that the excerpt he chose for wider publication is called \"Moving From Left to Right,\" and deftly summarizes the path he has taken. That same spirit, that same urgent mission flows through the entire book. He is not trying to lead. Nor is he trying to win votes. He is trying to translate--sometimes in both directions. In that task, he is invaluable.    \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0'"

       " 'WASHINGTON -- Releasing the Senate Intelligence Committee\\'s report on torture wasn\\'t even close to a close call. It was a necessary, if infuriatingly belated, corollary to the choice not to prosecute those who relied on faulty legal advice in engaging in such repugnant practices. The sordid episode called for national accountability, which is what the committee provided Tuesday. Nations, like individuals, cannot move on from traumatic moments without taking stock of their behavior. That rule holds especially true in the context of civil liberties, because of the recurring temptation to repeat problematic behaviors. Indeed, as Intelligence Committee Chairman Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., noted, President Obama\\'s self-imposed executive order to restrict the CIA from holding detainees and limit interrogation techniques to those in the Army Field Manual \"could be overturned by a future president with the stroke of a pen.\" As Feinstein argued, \"They should be enshrined in legislation.\" By contrast, the arguments against releasing the report, or for delaying its release, were flat-out wrong. Some -- from those who supported and orchestrated torture -- are self-interested and wrong. Others -- I\\'m talking about you, John Kerry -- were well-meaning and wrong. There will never be a comfortable time to disclose embarrassing information. No doubt some enemies of the United States will seize on the disclosures to protest, or worse. But the notion that the country\\'s enemies need an incentive to seek to harm our citizens is horribly belied by, among other things, the recent beheadings by the Islamic State. The contention that the risks of release are too great, and the practice so far in the rear-view mirror, would both reward CIA obstructionism in delaying release and ignore the fact that this debate, and practice, is capable of being repeated. The imperative for disclosure was clear in advance. But reading the stomach-churning findings of the 500-page executive summary, the only part cleared for declassification, reinforces its importance. No one can review this account without feeling horror and shame, and without feeling anger at the degree to which public officials and the public itself were misled about what was being done in the name of national security. Among the conclusions: So-called \"enhanced interrogation was \"not an effective means of obtaining accurate information.\" Instead, \"multiple CIA detainees fabricated information, resulting in faulty intelligence.\" Meanwhile, the interrogations \"were brutal and far worse than the CIA represented to policymakers and others.\" The techniques included, in addition to waterboardings that amounted to near-drownings, detainees being kept awake for up to 180 hours, detainees subjected to \"rectal rehydration,\" and detainees kept shackled in total darkness in dungeon-like conditions. Even as the CIA mistreated detainees, it submitted false claims about the effectiveness of the interrogation techniques and misled the Justice Department and others about what it was doing. Its claims of counterterrorism successes were \"wrong in fundamental respects,\" at best corroborating information already available or acquired before the application of enhanced interrogation. One of the most infuriating parts of the report concerns the degree to which the CIA submitted misleading information to the Justice Department lawyers called on to approve the enhanced interrogation techniques. I have argued, and continue to believe, that it would be unfair to prosecute individual CIA officers for engaging in torture based on distorted legal advice supplied by the Office of Legal Counsel. The now-discredited OLC opinions approved waterboarding, among other practices; that was wrong as a matter of law and morality. But the Senate report makes clear that OLC\\'s flawed advice was also based on inaccurate information provided by the CIA. One example involved a 2002 OLC memo permitting 10 interrogation techniques to be used against detainee Abu Zubaida.In seeking legal approval, the CIA both exaggerated Zubaida\\'s importance -- asserting incorrectly that he \"has been involved in every major terrorist operation carried out by al-Qaeda\" and \"was one of the planners\" of 9/11 -- and, again incorrectly, that interrogators were \"certain\" Zubaida was withholding \"critical threat information.\" Officials can\\'t defend themselves by claiming reliance on counsel that they themselves misled -- and the Zubaida episode was just part of a series of inaccurate representations. Moreover, the CIA, as the report details, was similarly unforthcoming not only with congressional overseers but with its own bosses at the White House. Feinstein, all too accurately, described the episode as \"a stain on our values and history.\" If that stain can never be erased, the committee\\'s report reflects an essential step in minimizing it.',\n",
       " \"I regret having to write a piece that is critical of the Democratic members of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. Most of them are former colleagues and friends. I hope they will remain friends after reading this. For eight years I served on this committee. I know how difficult and important the work of providing tough and fair oversight of our nation's $50 billion top-secret intelligence network.\",\n",

Chief among them is former Vice President Dick Cheney, one of the all-time great prisoner abuse enthusiasts. Even before the report was issued, Mr. Cheney was telling The New York Times on Monday that torturing prisoners was absolutely the right thing to do and that everything the C.I.A. did was authorized.']"
